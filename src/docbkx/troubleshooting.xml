             <title>zkcli</title>
              <para><code>zkcli</code> is a very useful tool for investigating ZooKeeper-related issues.  To invoke:
<programlisting>
./dcs zkcli -server host:port &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;args&gt;
</programlisting>
              The commands (and arguments) are:
<programlisting>
	connect host:port
	get path [watch]
	ls path [watch]
	set path data [version]
	delquota [-n|-b] path
	quit 
	printwatches on|off
	create [-s] [-e] path data acl
	stat path [watch]
	close 
	ls2 path [watch]
	history 
	listquota path
	setAcl path acl

        <title>tail</title>
        <para>
        <code>tail</code> is the command line tool that lets you look at the end of a file. Add the “-f” option and it will refresh when new data is available. It’s useful when you are wondering what’s happening, for example, when a cluster is taking a long time to shutdown or startup as you can just fire a new terminal and tail the master log (and maybe a few DcsServers).

        <title>top</title>
        <para>         
        <code>top</code> is probably one of the most important tool when first trying to see what’s running on a machine and how the resources are consumed. Here’s an example from production system:

        Here we can see that the system load average during the last five minutes is 3.75, which very roughly means that on average 3.75 threads were waiting for CPU time during these 5 minutes.  In general, the “perfect” utilization equals to the number of cores, under that number the machine is under utilized and over that the machine is over utilized.  This is an important concept, see this article to understand it more: <link xlink:href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9001">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9001</link>.
        </para>
        <para>
        Apart from load, we can see that the system is using almost all its available RAM but most of it is used for the OS cache (which is good). The swap only has a few KBs in it and this is wanted, high numbers would indicate swapping activity which is the nemesis of performance of Java systems. Another way to detect swapping is when the load average goes through the roof (although this could also be caused by things like a dying disk, among others).
        </para>
        <para>
        The list of processes isn’t super useful by default, all we know is that 3 java processes are using about 111% of the CPUs. To know which is which, simply type “c” and each line will be expanded. Typing “1” will give you the detail of how each CPU is used instead of the average for all of them like shown here.

        <code>jps</code> is shipped with every JDK and gives the java process ids for the current user (if root, then it gives the ids for all users). Example:
