  3. Distribution Obligations.
  
  3.1. Availability of Source Code.
  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
  Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
  Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
  Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
  recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
  obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
  through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

  3.2. Modifications.
  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
  terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are
  Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
  conveyed by this License.

  3.3. Required Notices.
  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
  the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
  patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
  notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
  Contributor or the Initial Developer.
  
  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
  Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
  of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
  clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
  offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
  such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
  You offer.
  
  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
  of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
  contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
  with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form
  does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
  form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
  Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.6. Larger Works.
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
  governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Covered Software.
  
  4. Versions of the License.
  
  4.1. New Versions.
  Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions
  of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
  version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
  steward has the right to modify this License.

  4.2. Effect of New Versions.
  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
  available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
  received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the
  Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
  Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
  which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
  to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the
  terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
  
  4.3. Modified Versions.
  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
  Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a)
  rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward
  (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
  make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

  5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
  
  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
  COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
  OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
  LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
  THIS DISCLAIMER.
  
  6. TERMINATION.
  
  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
  survive.
  
  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
  judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
  Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
  “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
  Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
  the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
  patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
  Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
  Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
  shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
  automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
  such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
  Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
  agreement with Participant.
  
  6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
  the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
  claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
  patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into
  account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
  
  6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
  licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
  prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
  shall survive termination.
  
  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
  CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
  SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
  FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
  ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
  INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
  NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
  NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
  
  The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that
  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
  software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
  those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
  and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
  Government rights in computer software under this License.
  
  9. MISCELLANEOUS.
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
  This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable
  law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
  jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
  for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
  fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
  for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
  which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
  drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
  responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
  regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
  when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
  
  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
  
  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
    
  NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
  
  The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
  California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
  Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
  with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

  contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
  with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
  not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form
  from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
  Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
  offer.
  
  3.6. Larger Works.
  
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
  governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Covered Software.
  
  4. Versions of the License.
  
  4.1. New Versions.
  
  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
  and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
  given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
  other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
  
  4.2. Effect of New Versions.
  
  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
  Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
  originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
  notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
  otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
  distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
  version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
  Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
  Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
  published by the license steward.
  
  4.3. Modified Versions.
  
  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
  Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
  License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
  and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
  from this License.
  
  5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
  
  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
  COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
  OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
  LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
  THIS DISCLAIMER.
  
  6. TERMINATION.
  
  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
  survive.
  
  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
  actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
  Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”)
  alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
  the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant
  is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
  and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
  Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
  Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
  notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
  expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
  withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
  Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
  Participant.
  
  6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
  licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
  prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
  shall survive termination.
  
  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
  CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
  SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
  FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
  
  The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that
  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
  software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
  those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
  and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
  Government rights in computer software under this License.
  
  9. MISCELLANEOUS.
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
  This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable
  law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law
  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
  jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
  for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’
  fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
  for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
  which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
  drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
  responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
  regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
  when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
  
  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
  
  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 
  NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
  
  The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
  California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
  Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
  with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

The binary distribution of Apache Trafodion DCS bundles Display Tag Library
software which is available under the Artistic License.
http://displaytag.sf.net

 The Artistic License

 Preamble

  The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
  Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
  semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
  while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
  the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
  reasonable modifications.

    "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
    created through textual modification.

    "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
    of the Copyright Holder.

    "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
    copyrights for the package.

    "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
    this Package.

    "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
    basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
    and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
    Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
    as a market that must bear the fee.)

    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
    itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
    It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
    under the same conditions they received it.


  1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
  Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
  duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.


  2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
  derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
  modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.


  3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
  when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
  following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
      an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
      site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
      your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
      with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
      a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
      documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.


  4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
  executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
      together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
      to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
      the Package with your modifications.

    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
      Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
      non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
      pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get
      the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.


  5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
  Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
  you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
  commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
  distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
  product of your own.


  6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
  output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
  under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
  them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
  Package.


  7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
  shall not be considered part of this Package.


  8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.


  9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  JPython 1.1.x Software License.
  ______________________________________________________________________

    1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Corporation for National Research
       Initiatives, having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA
       20191 ("CNRI"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee")
       accessing and using JPython version 1.1.x in source or binary form and
       its associated documentation as provided herein ("Software").

    2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI
       hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,
       world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display
       publicly, prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use the
       Software alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that
       CNRI's License Agreement and CNRI's notice of copyright, i.e.,
       "Copyright ï¿½1996-1999 Corporation for National Research Initiatives;
       All Rights Reserved" are both retained in the Software, alone or in any
       derivative version prepared by Licensee.

       Alternatively, in lieu of CNRI's License Agreement, Licensee may
       substitute the following text (omitting the quotes), provided, however,
       that such text is displayed prominently in the Software alone or in any
       derivative version prepared by Licensee: "JPython (Version 1.1.x) is
       made available subject to the terms and conditions in CNRI's License
       Agreement. This Agreement may be located on the Internet using the
       following unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle):

  B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
  =======================================================

  JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
  primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
  took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

  In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
  where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
  under the Jython specific license below.

  From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
  Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
  covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.

  The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
  license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.

  The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
  under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
  Software License.

  The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
  License.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

  3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or
  otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in
  Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
  terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy
  of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise
  make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
  Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
  form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
  software exchange.

  3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You
  contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
  believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
  sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

  3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your
  Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You
  may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
  within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive
  text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

  3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms
  on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
  applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may
  choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,
  you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
  and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
  result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable
  form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
  of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
  License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
  that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the
  recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
  License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
  different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
  or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
  with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
  Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
  requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

  4. Versions of the License.

  4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
  may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
  version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
  Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this
  License.

  4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute or
  otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
  the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
  Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
  from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
  of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
  under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
  received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
  distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
  any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

  4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
  create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a

  differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license
  contains terms which differ from this License.

  the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
  patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
  Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
