  Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or
  other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
  absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

  3. Distribution Obligations.
  
  3.1. Availability of Source Code.
  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
  Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
  Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
  Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
  recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
  obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
  through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

  3.2. Modifications.
  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
  terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are
  Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
  conveyed by this License.

  3.3. Required Notices.
  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
  the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
  patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
  notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
  Contributor or the Initial Developer.
  
  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
  Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
  of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
  clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
  offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
  such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
  You offer.
  
  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
  of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
  contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
  with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form
  does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
  form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
  Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.6. Larger Works.
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
  governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Covered Software.
  
  4. Versions of the License.
  
  4.1. New Versions.
  Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions
  of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
  version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
  steward has the right to modify this License.

  4.2. Effect of New Versions.
  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
  available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
  received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the
  Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
  Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
  which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
  to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the
  terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
  
  4.3. Modified Versions.
  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
  Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a)
  rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward
  (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
  make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

  5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
  
  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
  COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
  OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
  LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
  THIS DISCLAIMER.
  
  6. TERMINATION.
  
  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
  survive.
  
  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
  judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
  Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
  “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
  Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
  the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
  patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
  Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
  Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
  shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
  automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
  such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
  Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
  agreement with Participant.
  
  6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
  the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such
  claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
  patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into
  account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
  
  6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
  licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
  prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
  shall survive termination.
  
  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
  CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
  SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
  FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
  ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
  INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
  NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
  NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
  
  The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that
  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
  software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
  those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
  and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
  Government rights in computer software under this License.
  
  9. MISCELLANEOUS.
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
  This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable
  law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
  jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
  for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
  fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
  for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
  which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
  drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
  responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
  regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
  when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
  
  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
  
  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
    
  NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
  
  The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
  California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
  Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
  with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.
  
  
  
  The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
  
  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  59 Temple Place,
  Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
  
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  Preamble
  
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
  software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
  of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
  authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
  covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
  do these things.
    
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
  deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
  translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
  software, or if you modify it.
  
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
  a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
  sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
  these terms so they know their rights.
  
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
  offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
  and/or modify the software.
  
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
  everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
  software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
  know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
  others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
  
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
  wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
  obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
  this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
  use or not licensed at all.
  
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.
  
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
  placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
  work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
  Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
  limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
  by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
  not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
  running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
  you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
  keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
  at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
  thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
  modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also
  meet all of these conditions:
  
  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
  you changed the files and the date of any change.
  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
  in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
  licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
  cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
  way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
  notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
  a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
  and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the
  Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
  your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections
  of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
  independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do
  not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the
  Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
  each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
  right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
  Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
  the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
  License.
  
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
  Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
  above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
  which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
  customarily used for software interchange; or,
  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
  any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
  source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
  code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
  customarily used for software interchange; or,
  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
  corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
  distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
  form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
  source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
  of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
  need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
  binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
  accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
  code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
  third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
  expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
  rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
  or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
  accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
  work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
  so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
  Program or works based on it.
  
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
  copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
  rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
  parties to this License.
  
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
  are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
  contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
  conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
  the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
  entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
  section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
  distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
  choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
  consequence of the rest of this License.
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
  holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
  License.
  
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
  General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
  or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
  version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
  that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
  whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
  permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
  all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
  software generally.
  
  NO WARRANTY
  
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
  THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
  "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
  PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
  TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
  THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
  PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as
  provided by Oracle in the License file that accompanied this code." 
  
  Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
  combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
  General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination. 
  
  As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
  permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
  executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
  copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
  provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
  conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
  which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library,
  you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
  obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception

  or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
  software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)
  under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
  Modifications made by that Contributor.
  
  3. Distribution Obligations.
  
  3.1. Availability of Source Code.
  
  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
  Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
  Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
  include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
  Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
  recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
  obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
  through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
  
  3.2. Modifications.
  
  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by
  the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are
  Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
  conveyed by this License.
  
  3.3. Required Notices.
  
  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
  the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
  patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
  notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
  Contributor or the Initial Developer.
  
  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
  
  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
  form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
  of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
  clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
  offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
  such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
  You offer.
  
  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
  
  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
  of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
  contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
  with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
  not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form
  from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
  Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
  offer.
  
  3.6. Larger Works.
  
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
  governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
  product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
  fulfilled for the Covered Software.
  
  4. Versions of the License.
  
  4.1. New Versions.
  
  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
  and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
  given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
  other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
  
  4.2. Effect of New Versions.
  
  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
  Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
  originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
  notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
  otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
  distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
  version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
  Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
  Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
  published by the license steward.
  
  4.3. Modified Versions.
  
  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
  Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
  License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
  and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
  from this License.
  
  5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
  
  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
  COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
  OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
  LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
  THIS DISCLAIMER.
  
  6. TERMINATION.
  
  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
  their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
  survive.
  
  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
  actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
  Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”)
  alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
  the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant
  is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
  and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
  Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
  Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
  notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
  expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
  withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
  Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
  Participant.
  
  6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
  licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
  prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
  shall survive termination.
  
  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  
  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
  CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
  SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
  FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  
  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
  
  The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that
  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
  software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
  those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
  and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
  Government rights in computer software under this License.
  
  9. MISCELLANEOUS.
  
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
  This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable
  law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law
  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
  jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
  notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
  for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’
  fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
  for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
  which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
  drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
  responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
  regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
  when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
  
  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
  
  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 
  NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
  
  The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
  California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
  this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
  Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
  with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.
  
  The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
  
  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite
  330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
  
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  Preamble
  
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
  software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
  of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
  authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
  covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
  do these things.
  
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
  deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
  translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
  software, or if you modify it.
  
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
  a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
  sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
  these terms so they know their rights.
  
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
  offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
  and/or modify the software.
  
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
  everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
  software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
  know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
  others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
  
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
  wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
  obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
  this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
  use or not licensed at all.
  
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.
  
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
  placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
  work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
  Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
  limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
  by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is
  not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
  running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
  you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
  keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
  warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
  along with the Program.
  
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
  at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
  thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
  modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also
  meet all of these conditions:
  
  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
  you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
  part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
  as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
  
  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
  must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
  ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
  copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
  you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
  conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:
  if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
  announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an
  announcement.)
  
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
  sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
  considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
  its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
  works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
  work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
  and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
  right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
  Program.
  
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
  the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
  License.
  
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
  Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
  above provided that you also do one of the following:
  
  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
  which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
  customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
  any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
  source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
  source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
  medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  
  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
  distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
  noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code
  or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
  
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
  source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
  of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
  need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
  binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
  accompanies the executable.
  
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
  code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
  third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
  expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
  rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
  or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
  accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
  work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
  so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
  Program or works based on it.
  
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
  copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
  rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
  parties to this License.
  
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
  are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
  contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
  conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
  the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
  entirely from distribution of the Program.
  
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
  section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
  distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
  choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
  consequence of the rest of this License.
  
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
  holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
  License.
  
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
  General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
  or concerns.
  
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
  version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
  that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
  any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
  whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
  permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
  all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
  software generally.
  
  NO WARRANTY
  
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
  THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
  "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
  PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
  PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
  TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
  THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
  PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
  "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2
  
  Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the
  following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only
  where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the
  words "Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
  exception as provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."
  
  Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
  combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
  General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.
  
  As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
  permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
  executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
  copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
  provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
  conditions of the license of that module.? An independent module is a module
  which is not derived from or based on this library.? If you modify this library,
  you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
  obligated to do so.? If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
  statement from your version.

The binary distribution of Apache Trafodion DCS bundles Display Tag Library
software which is available under the Artistic License.
http://displaytag.sf.net

 The Artistic License

 Preamble

  The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
  Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
  semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
  while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
  the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
  reasonable modifications.

    "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
    Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
    created through textual modification.

    "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
    modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
    of the Copyright Holder.

    "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
    copyrights for the package.

    "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
    this Package.

    "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
    basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
    and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
    Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
    as a market that must bear the fee.)

    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
    itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
    It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
    under the same conditions they received it.


  1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
  Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
  duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.


  2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
  derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
  modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.


  3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
  that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
  when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
  following:

    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
      Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
      an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
      site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
      your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
      with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
      a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
      documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.


  4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
  executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
      together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
      to get the Standard Version.

    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
      the Package with your modifications.

    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
      Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
      non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual
      pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get
      the Standard Version.

    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.


  5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
  Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.
  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
  you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
  commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
  distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
  product of your own.


  6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
  output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
  under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
  them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
  Package.


  7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package
  shall not be considered part of this Package.


  8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
  products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.


  9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  JPython 1.1.x Software License.
  ______________________________________________________________________

    1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Corporation for National Research
       Initiatives, having an office at 1895 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA
       20191 ("CNRI"), and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee")
       accessing and using JPython version 1.1.x in source or binary form and
       its associated documentation as provided herein ("Software").

    2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI
       hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free,
       world-wide license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display
       publicly, prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use the
       Software alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that
       CNRI's License Agreement and CNRI's notice of copyright, i.e.,
       "Copyright ï¿½1996-1999 Corporation for National Research Initiatives;
       All Rights Reserved" are both retained in the Software, alone or in any
       derivative version prepared by Licensee.

       Alternatively, in lieu of CNRI's License Agreement, Licensee may
       substitute the following text (omitting the quotes), provided, however,
       that such text is displayed prominently in the Software alone or in any
       derivative version prepared by Licensee: "JPython (Version 1.1.x) is
       made available subject to the terms and conditions in CNRI's License
       Agreement. This Agreement may be located on the Internet using the
       following unique, persistent identifier (known as a handle):

  B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
  =======================================================

  JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
  primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
  took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

  In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
  where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
  under the Jython specific license below.

  From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
  Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
  covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.

  The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
  license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.

  The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
  under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
  Software License.

  The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
  License.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

  for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for
  infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version,
  or (ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other
  software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)
  under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
  Modifications made by that Contributor.

  3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or
  otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in
  Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
  terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy
  of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise
  make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
  Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
  form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
  software exchange.

  3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You
  contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
  believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
  sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

  3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of Your
  Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You
  may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
  within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive
  text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

  3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or impose any terms
  on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
  applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may
  choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,
  you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
  Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
  and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
  for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
  result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the Executable
  form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
  of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
  License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
  that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the
  recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
  License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
  different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
  differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
  or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
  with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
  Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
  requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

  4. Versions of the License.

  4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
  may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
  version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
  Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this
  License.

  4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute or
  otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
  the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
  Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
  from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
  of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
  under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
  received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
  distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
  any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

  4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
  create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
  modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
  references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license
  differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license
  contains terms which differ from this License.
