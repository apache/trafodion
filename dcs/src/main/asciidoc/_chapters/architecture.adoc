[[arch-overview]]
== Overview   
[[arch-overview-dcs]]
=== DCS  
DCS, see figure <<img-dcs,Figure 1>>, is a framework that connects 
ODBC/JDBC Type 4 clients to Trafodion user programs (MXOSRVR servers). In a nutshell, clients connect to a listening 
DcsMaster on a well known port. DcsMaster looks in ZooKeeper for an "available"
DcsServer user program (MXOSRVR) and returns an object reference to that server back to the client.
The client then connects directly to the MXOSRVR. After the initial startup DcsMaster restarts any failed
DcsServers. And, DcsServers restart any failed MXOSRVRs.

DCS provides the following:  

* A lightweight process management framework. 
* High performance client listener using Java NIO.  
* Simple configuration and startup 
* A highly available and scaleable Trafodion connectivity service.
* Uses ZooKeeper as backbone for coordination and process management. 
* Embedded user interface to examine state, logs, process status.            
* Standalone REST server. 
* 100% Java implementation.

[[arch-client]]
== Client   
The Trafodion ODBC/JDBC Type 4 client drivers connect to MXOSRVRs through the DCS Master.
	
[[arch-dcsmaster]]
== DcsMaster 
_DcsMaster_ is the implementation of the Master Server. The Master server
is responsible for listening for client connection requests, monitoring all DcsServer instances in the cluster
and restarting any DcsServers that fail after initial startup.

[[master-startup]]
=== Startup Behavior 
The DcsMaster is started via the scripts found in the _/bin_ directory. During startup it registers itself in Zookeeper.
If the DcsMaster is started as a backup then after registering in Zookeeper it waits to become the next DcsMaster leader.
If ever the backup becomes the leader it executes the _bin/dcsbind.sh_ script to enable floating IP on a given interface and
IP address.

[[master-runtime]]
=== Runtime Impact 
A common question is what happens to an DCS cluster when the DcsMaster goes down. Because the
DcsMaster doesn't affect the running DcsServers or connected clients, the cluster can still function 
i.e., clients already connected to MXOSRVRs can continue to work. However, the DcsMaster controls critical
functions such as listening for clients and restarting DcsServers. So, while the cluster can still run for
a time without the DcsMaster, it should be restarted as soon as possible.     

=== High Availability 
Please refer to section <<ha.configurations, High Availability>>
         
[[master-processes]]
=== Processes
The DcsMaster runs several background threads:
         
==== Listener 
The listener thread is responsible for servicing client requests. It pairs
each client with an registered MXOSRVR found in Zookeeper. A default port
is configured but this may be changed in the configuration by modifying               
the _dcs.master.port_ and _dcs.master.port.range_ properties.
         
[[master-processes-server-manager]]
==== ServerManager 
The server manager thread is responsible for monitoring and restarting its child DcsServers. It  
runs a server handler for each DcsServer found in _conf/servers_.

[[server-arch]]
== DcsServer 
_DcsServer_ is the server implementation. It is responsible for starting and keeping
its Trafodion user program (MXOSRVR) running.
       
[[server-startup]]
=== Startup Behavior 
The DcsServer is started via the scripts found in the _/bin_ directory. During startup it registers itself in Zookeeper. 
         
[[server-runtime]]
=== Runtime Impact 
The DcsServer can continue to function if the DcsMaster goes down. the cluster can still function in a "steady 
state." However, the DcsMaster controls critical functions such as DcsServer failure and.  
So while the cluster can still run for a time without the DcsMaster, 
the DcsMaster should be restarted as soon as possible.     
         
[[server-arch-processes]]
=== Processes 
The DcsServer runs a variety of background threads:

[[server-processes-server-manager]]
==== ServerManager
The server manager thread is responsible for monitoring and restarting its child MXOSRVRs. It  
runs a server handler for each MXOSRVR found after the hostname in _conf/servers_.
                  
[[server-processes-script-manager]]
==== ScriptManager
The script manager thread is responsible for readng and compiling the script used to run the MXOSRVR. It  
can detect a change in any script found in _bin/scripts_. If any file changes it will
reload and compile the changed script.
