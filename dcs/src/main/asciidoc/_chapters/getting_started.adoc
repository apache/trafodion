== Introduction
<<quickstart,Quick Start>> will get you up and running on a single-node instance of DCS. 
<<configuration,Configuration>> describes setup of DCS in a multi-node configuration.

[[quickstart]]
== Quick Start

This guide describes setup of a single node DCS instance.
It leads you through creating a configuration, and then starting
up and shutting down your DCS instance. The below exercise
should take no more than ten minutes (not including download time).

=== Download and unpack the latest release.

Decompress and untar your download and then change into the unpacked directory.

---- 
 $ tar xzf dcs-{projectVersion}.tar.gz
 $ cd dcs-{projectVersion}
----

Is _java_ installed? 

The steps in the following sections presume a 1.7 version of Oracle
_java_ is installed on your machine and available on your path; i.e. when you type _java_, you see output that describes the
options the java program takes (DCS requires java 7 or better). If this is not the case, DCS will not start. 
Install _java_, edit _conf/dcs-env.sh_, uncommenting the `JAVA_HOME` line pointing it to your java install.
      
Is _Trafodion_ installed and running?

DCS presumes a _Trafodion_ instance is installed and running on your machine and available on your path; i.e. the
`MY_SQROOT` is set and when you type _sqcheck_, you see output that confirms _Trafodion_ is running. If this is not
the case, DCS may start but you'll see many errors in the DcsServer logs related to user program startup. 
      
At this point, you are ready to start DCS.

=== Starting DCS

Now start DCS:
----     
 $ bin/start-dcs.sh 
 localhost: starting zookeeper, logging to /logs/dcs-user-1-zookeeper-hostname.out
 localhost: running Zookeeper
 starting master, logging to /logs/dcs-user-1-master-hostname.out
 localhost: starting server, logging to /logs/dcs-user-1-server-hostname.out 
----

You should now have a running DCS instance. DCS logs can be found in the
_logs_ subdirectory. Peruse them especially if DCS had trouble starting.

=== Stopping DCS

Stop your DCS instance by running the stop script.
----
 $ ./bin/stop-dcs.sh
 localhost: stopping server.
 stopping master.
 localhost: stopping zookeeper.
----

Where to go next? 

The above described setup is good for testing and experiments only. Next move on to <<configuration,configuration>> 
where we'll go into depth on the different requirements and critical configurations needed setting up a distributed DCS deploy.
