[trouble-general]
== General Guidelines 

== Logs
The key process logs are as follows...(replace <user> with the user that started the service, <instance> for the server instance and <hostname> for the machine name)
 
* DcsMaster: $DCS_HOME/logs/dcs-<user>-<instance>-master-<hostname>.log
* DcsServer: $DCS_HOME/logs/dcs-<user>-<instance>-server-<hostname>.log
* ZooKeeper: $DCS_HOME/logs/dcs-<user>-<instance>-zookeeper-<hostname>.log

=== Builtin Tools

[[trouble-tools-builtin-webmaster]]
==== DcsMaster Web Interface
The DcsMaster starts a web-interface on port 24400 by default.
              
The DcsMaster web UI lists created DcsServers (e.g., build info, zookeeper quorum, metrics, etc.).  Additionally, 
the available DcsServers in the cluster are listed along with selected high-level metrics (listenerRequests, listenerCompletedRequests,
totalAvailable/totalConnected/totalConnecting MXOSRVRs, totalHeap, usedHeap, maxHeap, etc).
The DcsMaster web UI allows navigation to each DcsServer's web UI.
              
[[trouble-tools-builtin-webserver]]
==== DcsServer Web Interface
DcsServers starts a web-interface on port 24420 by default.
              
The DcsServer web UI lists its server metrics (build info, zookeeper quorum, usedHeap, maxHeap, etc.).

[[trouble-tools-builtin-zkcli]]
==== zkcli
_zkcli_ is a very useful tool for investigating ZooKeeper-related issues.  To invoke:
----
./dcs zkcli -server host:port <cmd> <args>
 
The commands (and arguments) are:
 
	connect host:port
	get path [watch]
	ls path [watch]
	set path data [version]
	delquota [-n|-b] path
	quit 
	printwatches on|off
	create [-s] [-e] path data acl
	stat path [watch]
	close 
	ls2 path [watch]
	history 
	listquota path
	setAcl path acl
	getAcl path
	sync path
	redo cmdno
	addauth scheme auth
	delete path [version]
	setquota -n|-b val path

[[trouble-tools-external]]
=== External Tools
[[trouble-tools-tail]]
==== tail 
        
_tail_ is the command line tool that lets you look at the end of a file. Add the “-f” option and it will refresh when new data is available. It’s useful when you are wondering what’s happening, for example, when a cluster is taking a long time to shutdown or startup as you can just fire a new terminal and tail the master log (and maybe a few DcsServers).

[[trouble-tools-top]]
==== top                 
_top_ is probably one of the most important tool when first trying to see what’s running on a machine and how the resources are consumed. Here’s an example from production system:

----
top - 14:46:59 up 39 days, 11:55,  1 user,  load average: 3.75, 3.57, 3.84
Tasks: 309 total,   1 running, 308 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s):  4.5%us,  1.6%sy,  0.0%ni, 91.7%id,  1.4%wa,  0.1%hi,  0.6%si,  0.0%st
Mem:  24414432k total, 24296956k used,   117476k free,     7196k buffers

Here we can see that the system load average during the last five minutes is 3.75, which very roughly means that on average 3.75 threads were waiting for CPU time during these 5 minutes.  In general, the “perfect” utilization equals to the number of cores, under that number the machine is under utilized and over that the machine is over utilized.  This is an important concept, see this article to understand it more: link:http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9001[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9001].
Apart from load, we can see that the system is using almost all its available RAM but most of it is used for the OS cache (which is good). The swap only has a few KBs in it and this is wanted, high numbers would indicate swapping activity which is the nemesis of performance of Java systems. Another way to detect swapping is when the load average goes through the roof (although this could also be caused by things like a dying disk, among others).
The list of processes isn’t super useful by default, all we know is that 3 java processes are using about 111% of the CPUs. To know which is which, simply type “c” and each line will be expanded. Typing “1” will give you the detail of how each CPU is used instead of the average for all of them like shown here.

[[trouble-tools-jps]]
==== jps
_jps_ is shipped with every JDK and gives the java process ids for the current user (if root, then it gives the ids for all users). Example:
----
21160 DcsMaster
21248 DcsServer
----
       
[[trouble-zookeeper]]
== ZooKeeper

=== Startup Errors

[[trouble-zookeeper-startup-address]]
==== Could not find my address: xyz in list of ZooKeeper quorum servers

A ZooKeeper server wasn't able to start, throws that error. xyz is the name of your server.
This is a name lookup problem. DCS tries to start a ZooKeeper server on some machine but that machine isn't able to find itself in the _dcs.zookeeper.quorum_ configuration.  
                       
Use the hostname presented in the error message instead of the value you used. If you have a DNS server, you can set _dcs.zookeeper.dns.interface_ and _dcs.zookeeper.dns.nameserver_ in _dcs-site.xml_ to 
make sure it resolves to the correct FQDN.  
 
[[trouble-zookeeper-general]]
==== ZooKeeper, The Cluster Canary
ZooKeeper is the cluster's "canary in the mineshaft". It'll be the first to notice issues if any so making sure its happy is the short-cut to a humming cluster.

See the link:http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/Troubleshooting[ZooKeeper Operating Environment Troubleshooting] page. 
It has suggestions and tools for checking disk and networking performance; i.e. the operating environment your ZooKeeper 
and DCS are running in.

Additionally, the utility <<trouble-tools-builtin-zkcli,zkcli>> may help investigate ZooKeeper issues.
