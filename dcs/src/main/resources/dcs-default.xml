    <description>
       Set this value to a percentage of the initial heap size (for example, value: 80), which you do not want the current heap size to exceed. 
       When the Trafodion session disconnects, the DCS server's user program checks its current heap size. If the difference between its current
       and initial heap sizes exceeds this percentage, the user program will exit, and the DCS server will restart it. If the difference between
       its current and initial heap sizes does not exceed this percentage, the user program will be allowed to keep running. The default is 0,
       which means that the heap size is not checked after the session disconnects and the user program keeps running.

  <property>
    <name>dcs.dns.interface</name>
    <value>default</value>
    <description>Dcs uses the local host name for reporting its IP address. If your machine
        has multiple interfaces DCS will use the interface that the primary
        host name resolves to. If this is insufficient, you can set this property
        to indicate the primary interface e.g., "eth1". This only works if your cluster 
        configuration is consistent and every host has the same network interface
        configuration.

  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dcs.info.threads.max</name>
    <value>100</value>
    <description>
        The maximum number of threads of the info server thread pool.
        Threads in the pool are reused to process requests. This
        controls the maximum number of requests processed concurrently.
        It may help to control the memory used by the info server to
        avoid out of memory issues. If the thread pool is full, incoming requests
        will be queued up and wait for some free threads. The default
        is 100.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dcs.info.threads.min</name>
    <value>2</value>
    <description>
        The minimum number of threads of the info server thread pool.
        The thread pool always has at least these number of threads so
        the info server is ready to serve incoming requests. The default
        is 2.
    </description>
  </property>  
  <property>
    <name>dcs.server.handler.threads.max</name>
    <value>10</value>

  <property>
    <name>dcs.zookeeper.dns.interface</name>

  <property>
    <name>zookeeper.session.timeout</name>
    <value>180000</value>
    <description>ZooKeeper session timeout.
      dcs passes this to the zk quorum as suggested maximum time for a
      session (This setting becomes zookeeper's 'maxSessionTimeout').  See
      http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkSessions
      "The client sends a requested timeout, the server responds with the
      timeout that it can give the client. " In milliseconds.

  </property>
  <property>
    <name>zookeeper.znode.parent</name>
    <value>/${user.name}</value>
    <description>Root Znode for dcs in ZooKeeper. All of dcs's ZooKeeper
      znodes that are configured with a relative path will go under this node.
      By default, all of dcs's ZooKeeper file path are configured with a
      relative path, so they will all go under this directory unless changed.

  <property>
    <name>dcs.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>localhost</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost. For a fully-distributed setup, 
    this should be set to a full list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. 
    If DCS_MANAGES_ZK is set in dcs-env.sh this is the list of servers which
    we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.

  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dcs.zookeeper.useMulti</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>Instructs DCS to make use of ZooKeeper's multi-update functionality.
    This allows certain ZooKeeper operations to complete more quickly and prevents some issues
    with rare ZooKeeper failure scenarios (see the release note of HBASE-6710 for an example).
    IMPORTANT: only set this to true if all ZooKeeper servers in the cluster are on version 3.4+
    and will not be downgraded.  ZooKeeper versions before 3.4 do not support multi-update and will
    not fail gracefully if multi-update is invoked (see ZOOKEEPER-1495).
