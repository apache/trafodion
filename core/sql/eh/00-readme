File name     00-readme

Description:  This directory contains a package to provide temporary
              support for exception handling (until the Tandem Native
              Mode C++ compiler provides the C++ exception handling
              support).  This exception handling package cut back the
              runtime stack by calling the C runtime function longjmp.
              The destructors of the cut-back automatic instances will
              not be invoked.

              For more information about this exception handling
              package and how the package is used, please read the
              content of the header file EHException.h in the same
              directory.
