// Since executor libraries are packaged in 2 ways ( user )
// . tdm_sqlcli.dll, this is for application programmer
// . cli, executor, exp, common, ..etc. static linked libs
//   for internal components
// For a program both statically and dynamically linked in these
// libraries gets more than one set of global variables which causes

// DLL and linked in to tdm_sqlcli.dll , also any other programs needs
// to link cli.lib
