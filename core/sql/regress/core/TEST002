-- Functionality: Union all with joins and aggregates, various joins,
--                subqueries with aggregates, correlated subqueries.
-- Table created: t002t1, t002t2, t002t3, t002ut1, t002ut2,
--                t002ZZ, t002ZZI, t002FU, t002FUI
-- Expected files: EXPECTED002, EXPECTED002.MP
-- Limitations:
-- To do: - Remove DIFF002.KNOWN.NSK when Unicode is supported on MX tables
--          while Unicode may never be supported on MP tables
--          (Done 5/19/02)
-- Revision history:
--     (2/20/02) - Created with most subquery tests from TEST002 (Executor)
--     (3/01/02) - Comment off Unicode tests for MP tables
--     (5/19/02) - Removed DIFF002.KNOWN.NSK as unicode is supported.
