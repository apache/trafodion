-- Functionality: Multi-Value predicates
-- Expected files: EXPECTED041, EXPECTED041.MP
-- Table created: t041a, t041t
-- To do: - Should change expected error number 3145 to 3147.
-- Limitations:
-- Revision history:
--     (1/28/02) - Copied from fullstack/TEST041
--     (5/16/02) - Expected error number 3145 changed to 3147.

--
-- Multi-Value Predicates, aka row-value-constructors in preds
--
-- Ideally, these tests should run the same row-subqueries on three stages
-- of the underlying table such that subq returns a) zero, b) one, c) >1 row.
-- Case (c) is run-time error 8401.
