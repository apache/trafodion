-- Functionality: Hash join and hash groupby overflow
-- Expected file: EXPECTED019
-- Filter file: FILTER019
-- Tables created: t019t1, t019t2, t019_starter
--                 t019_a, t019_b, t019_c, t019_d, t019_e, t019_f, t019_g, upsertx
-- Limitations: Only tests overflow in the master executor
-- Revision history:
--     (1/28/02) - Copied from fullstack/TEST019
--     (1/18/08) - Made the Hash-Join and Hash-Groupby to really overflow 
--                 (statistics gives a proof). Also testing inputs and
--                 before/after predicates and a having clause.
--    (10/27/08) - Fixed some test bugs; added overflow tests for anti-semi
--                 (including cluster splits and hash-loops) and hash-groupby
--                 (including resize of the hash table, and distict grouping).
