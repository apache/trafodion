# Remove the query output that contains the actal MDAM costs, since they are
# likely to change slightly over time and cause false regressions. The filtered
# output contains information on whether or not MDAM was used for each of the
# tested key predicates, and a list of any for which the plan selection is at
# odds with the cost. The unfiltered log output can be consulted if the actual
# costs are of interest.
# Also filter out table and histogram ids from the showstats output.
