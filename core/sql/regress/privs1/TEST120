-- Design:
--    t120role1 - owns schema t120sch 
--    t120role2 - contains grants against teams and games
--    t120role3 - contains grants against teams, games, and standings
--    t120role4 - control, has no privs granted, make sure revoking
--                role does not cause recompilations
--
--    sql_user3 - is schema administrator for schema t120sch
--    sql_user6 - is granted and revoked privileges directly and
--                through t120role2 and t120role3
--    sql_user9 - control, makes sure revokes from roles does not
--                affect sql_user9's compiled queries
--
--    games     - multiple roles giving same privileges
--    teams     - multiple privileges through different roles
--    players   - control, no roles involved in privileges
--    standings - used to test sequence privileges and revoke role
--    stats     - tests revoke PUBLIC authorization ID
