-- ============================================================================
-- All tables are created as EXTERNAL in a location already setup by 
-- install_local_hadoop. The EXTERNAL keyword lets you create a table and 
-- provide a LOCATION so that Hive does not use the default location 
-- specified by the configuration property hive.metastore.warehouse.dir.
-- ============================================================================

-- Our version of HIVE does not support special characters.  This test should 
-- be changed to use delimited names once we upgrade HIVE.

-- Our version of HIVE does not support insert ... VALUES clause, so use the
-- load command from an existing table.
