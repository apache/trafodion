Steps to run optimizer regression test on NT:
  1.  start services and TMF; initialize SQL if you haven't yet
  2.  cd w:/regress/opt
  3.  ./runopt

Steps to run optimizer regression test on NSK:
  1.  To run optimizer regression on NSK, you need:
      a. SMF must be up & running, and configured to allow 100 or so partitions.
	 ***As of 02/16/00, none of the standalones has such an SMF --
	 ***talk to Marek Fridrich and/or Doris Thompson.
      b. On NSK in OSS, create directory "opt" under "regress".
           e.g., cd /usr/yourname/regress; mkdir opt tools;
  2.  Ftp all files from  NT w:/regress/opt  ->  NSK /usr/yourname/regress/opt
  3.  Logon to your NSK standalone machine
  4.  Goto your catalog volume and subvolume
        e.g., volume $data04.yourcat
  5.  Goto OSS (osh)
  6.  You have probably already done all this prior to running other regression
      suites...but in case you haven't:
	a. Goto your regress/tools directory
	     e.g., cd /usr/yourname/regress/tools
	b. Edit setupnskenv, changing the "export rundir" line to, e.g.,
	     export rundir=/usr/yourname/regress
	c. Optionally, source your new setupnskenv:
	     . setupnskenv	# i.e., "dot space setupnskenv"
	   This is optional because
	     opt/runopt     runs  tools/runregr and
	     tools/runregr  runs  tools/setupnskenv
  7.  Goto your regress/opt directory
        e.g., cd /usr/yourname/regress/opt
  8.  You're ready:
        ./runopt
