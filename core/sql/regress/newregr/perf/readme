This set of queries was developed to compare the execution time of key executor
operators with different build labels. 

To run the script, type the following in korn shell:

./runregr [-ndb]

The ndb flag indicates that no database creation will take place.  Use this
flag only if a valid database is present.

The result summary is stored in the runregr.log file.  This file contains the 
execution time for each of the 9 queries as well as elapsed time for each of
the import runs.  To see more detail stats information on a particular query, 
check the query?.log files.  

The result of each of the queries is compared against the base number for that 
query.  For each machine, a file should exist containing the base numbers with 
which all future tests will be compared.  This file must be added manually by
the person running the test.  This is a one-time procedure, and the base file
should be updated periodically to reflect permanent improvement (or 
degradation) in performance.

To create a base file for a particular machine, do the following steps:

1) run the 'runregr' script (note that none of the tests will pass because 
   there's no base file) and a file named "runregr.log" will be produced

2) find out the name of your machine by typing the command 

    echo ${COMPUTERNAME}

3) If you want to use the "runregr.log" as the base file, just rename the
   file to "base.{COMPUTERNAME}".  For example, if the name of my computer
   is "nssw-yuanm", then the base file for my machine is base.nssw-yuanm

4) You may want to run the script a few times, thus creating several log files.
   The base file can then be created by using one of the log files and 
   manually changing the results in the file to reflect the average time for
   the queries.

With each run of the script, an entry is added to the history.MACHINE_NAME.log 
file.  This file is not deleted by the script.  This file provides history 
information on the elapsed time of the script.  There's one history file for
each machine where this script is run.  For the build machines, when the test
is executed for the first time on that machine, the history.MACHINE_NAME.log
file needs to be added to clearcase manually by the build coordinator.

For the build machines, the script is set up to only run when the build is a
release build.  A environment variable FLAVOR is checked for the value Debug.
If the env variable is present and the value is "Debug", the test is not 
executed.

The program SetCache.exe that is included in the w:/regress/perf directory is
copied from the y-area 990524sp1.  It is very possible that this application
will change later on.  In that case, the program needs to be copied again.  The
reason why I couldn't just execute the program from the Y-area is because the
bit testing environment doesn't have a y-area.
