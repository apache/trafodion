-- File: SQLQAT13                Formerly $cats.testest.qat010t
-- Component: NonStop SQL Regression Test Suite
-- Description:
--    This test unit is a positive local test for the select statement.
-- It tests only normal (non-join and non-subquery) select statements,
-- with GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses, and also tests some
-- complex queries that use all the clauses together.
--    This test unit uses the select global data base (sqldd01d).
-- Each test case in this test unit tests a particular feature of complex
-- normal select statements. For each test case, each base table
-- (tables 01 - 11) and at least one protection view and one shorthand
-- view have at least one select statement executed against them. This
-- is to assure that the particular feature that the test case is testing
-- works on all types of objects.
--    The test cases in this test unit are as follows:
--       testcase A0: GROUP BY
--       testcase A1: HAVING
--       testcase A2: ORDER BY
--       testcase A3: complex queries - combinations of all features
--       testcase A4: use of locking clauses (for read committed access, for read committed access, keep
--                    lock) with above clauses
--       testcase A5: variation of ordering of WHERE,GROUP BY,HAVING,
--                    ORDER ,locking clauses
--       testcase A6: variation of amount of white space (including
--                    blank lines) and upper/lower case
--       testcase A7: select aggregate functions with GROUP BY
--       testcase A8: select aggregate functions with HAVING and complex
--                    queries
--       testcase A9: select .. GROUP BY with ordinal numbers

-- All testcases are documented further below
