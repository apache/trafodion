-- Component: NonStop SQL Regression Test Suite
-- Description:
--   This test unit is a positive local test for the select statement.
--It tests SELECT statements with uncorrelated subqueries in their WHERE
--clauses.
--   This test unit uses the order-entry database (sqldd01d).  Each
--test case in this test unit tests a particular relationship between
--the outer query(s) and the subquery(s).  The following attributes
--are varied inside of testcases.  Note that all of these attributes
--are not tested in every testcase - some of these attributes only apply
--to certain types of tests.
--      Attributes varied:
--              objects:  joins
--                        subquery and outer query on same table
--                        views

--     columns selected:  one column
--                        * (one column table if not inside exists)
--                        distinct -- subquery only
--                                 -- outer query only
--                                 -- both
--  name qualifications:  necessary
--                        unnecessary

--              no where clause in subquery
--              group by/having in subquery
--              subquery returning only one record with IN,=ANY,=ALL

--   The test cases in this test unit are as follows:
--      testcase A0: SELECT ... WHERE ... IN ... SUBQUERY
--      testcase A1: simple comparison operators: SELECT ... WHERE ...
--                     (<,<=,=,<>,>,>=) ... SUBQUERY
--      testcase A2: quantified comparison operators: >=ANY,=ALL,etc.
--      testcase A3: multiple nested subqueries and multiple subqueries
--                   connected with AND,OR
--      testcase A4: subqueries with for read committed access, for read committed access,
--                   for read committed access
--      testcase A5: SELECT aggregate functions with aggregates in
--                   subquery

--All testcases are documented further below.
