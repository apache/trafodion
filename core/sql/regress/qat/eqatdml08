>>-- Component: NonStop SQL Regression Test Suite
>>-- Description:
>>--   This test unit is a positive local test for the select statement.
>>--It tests SELECT statements with uncorrelated subqueries in their WHERE
>>--clauses.
>>--   This test unit uses the order-entry database (sqldd01d).  Each
>>--test case in this test unit tests a particular relationship between
>>--the outer query(s) and the subquery(s).  The following attributes
>>--are varied inside of testcases.  Note that all of these attributes
>>--are not tested in every testcase - some of these attributes only apply
>>--to certain types of tests.
>>--      Attributes varied:
>>--              objects:  joins
>>--                        subquery and outer query on same table
>>--                        views
>>
>>--     columns selected:  one column
>>--                        * (one column table if not inside exists)
>>--                        distinct -- subquery only
>>--                                 -- outer query only
>>--                                 -- both
>>--  name qualifications:  necessary
>>--                        unnecessary
>>
>>--              no where clause in subquery
>>--              group by/having in subquery
>>--              subquery returning only one record with IN,=ANY,=ALL
>>
>>--   The test cases in this test unit are as follows:
>>--      testcase A0: SELECT ... WHERE ... IN ... SUBQUERY
>>--      testcase A1: simple comparison operators: SELECT ... WHERE ...
>>--                     (<,<=,=,<>,>,>=) ... SUBQUERY
>>--      testcase A2: quantified comparison operators: >=ANY,=ALL,etc.
>>--      testcase A3: multiple nested subqueries and multiple subqueries
>>--                   connected with AND,OR
>>--      testcase A4: subqueries with for read committed access, for read committed access,
>>--                   for read committed access
>>--      testcase A5: SELECT aggregate functions with aggregates in
>>--                   subquery
>>
