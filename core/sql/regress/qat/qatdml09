-- Component: NonStop SQL Regression Test Suite
-- Description:
--    This test unit is a positive local test for the select statement.
-- It tests SELECT statements with uncorrelated subqueries in their HAVING
-- clauses.
--    This test unit uses the order-entry database (sqldd01d).  Each
-- test case in this test unit tests a particular relationship between
-- the outer query(s) and the subquery(s).  The following attributes
-- are varied inside of testcases.  Note that all of these attributes
-- are not tested in every testcase - some of these attributes only apply
-- to certain types of tests.
--       Attributes varied:
--               objects:  joins
--                         subquery and outer query on same table
--                         views

--      columns selected:  one column
--                         * (one column table if not inside exists)
--                         distinct -- subquery only
--                                  -- outer query only
--                                  -- both
--   name qualifications:  necessary
--                         unnecessary

--               no where clause in subquery
--               group by/having in subquery
--               subquery returning only one record with IN,=ANY,=ALL

--    The test cases in this test unit are as follows:
--       testcase A0: SELECT ... HAVING ... IN ... SUBQUERY
--       testcase A1: simple comparison operators: SELECT ... HAVING ...
--                      (<,<=,=,<>,>,>=) ... SUBQUERY
--       testcase A2: quantified comparison operators: >=ANY,=ALL,etc.
--       testcase A3: multiple nested subqueries, multiple subqueries
--                    connected with AND,OR, and SELECTs with subqueries
--                    (uncorrelated) in both the WHERE clause and HAVING
--                    clause
--       testcase A4: subqueries with for read committed access,
--                    for read committed access, for read committed access
--       testcase A5: SELECT aggregate functions with aggregates in
--                    subquery


-- All testcases are documented further below.
