-- Component: NonStop SQL Regression Test Suite
-- Description:
--    This test unit is a positive local test for the select statement.
-- It tests only normal (non-join and non-subquery) select statements
-- in simple form (no clauses other than SELECT-FROM). In particular,
-- the select statements in this test unit have no where, group by,
-- or order by clauses.
--    This test unit uses the select global data base.
-- Each test case in this test unit tests a particular feature of
-- simple normal select statements. For each test case, each base table
-- (tables 01 - 11) and at least one protection view and one shorthand
-- view have at least one select stmt. executed against them. This is
-- to assure that the particular feature that the test case is testing
-- works on all types of objects.
--    The test cases in this test unit are as follows:
--       testcase A0: select one column from base tables, shorthand
--                    views, protection views
--       testcase A1: select distinct , select all
--       testcase A2: select syskey
--       testcase A3: select *
--       testcase A4: select an expression of a column
--       testcase A5: use of read committed access,
--         read committed access and repeatable access
--       testcase A6: select aggregate functions

-- All testcases are documented further below.

--        normal simple select test - select a column from base
--        tables, protection views, shorthand views.

--        This testcase selects a random column from base tables

--        tables 1 and 6 have all their column types selected to
--        check that select works on all column types.
