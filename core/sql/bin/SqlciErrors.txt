\
  -e  Causes Compiler to generate a warning instead of an error.\
  -v  Verbose mode.\
  -g moduleGlobal \
      Causes Compiler to place module into the global\
      /usr/tandem/sqlmx/USERMODULES directory.\
\
  -g moduleLocal[=OSSdir] \
      Causes Compiler to place module into the named\
      OSS directory. If OSSdir is omitted, Compiler\
      outputs module to the current directory.\
\
  -d  allows you to specify any SQL compiler control query\
      default settings at the command line.
2994 ZZZZZ 99999 BEGINNER MAJOR DBADMIN Usage: \
  mxCompileUserModule [-e][-v][-g {moduleGlobal|moduleLocal}] \
    [-d <Compiler attribute name>=<Compiler attribute value>]...\
    <application file> [{<module name>[,<module name>]...}]\
    \
  <application file> is the OSS pathname of a self-contained\
    application executable file, native user library, or SQLJ\
    jar or profile ser file.\
    \
  If no <module name> is specified, mxCompileUserModule\
    operates on all embedded module definitions of\
    <application file>. Otherwise, each <module name> is\
    the fully qualified three-part name of an embedded module\
    definition in <application file>, and mxCompileUserModule\
    operates only on the named embedded module definitions.\
    \
  -e causes Compiler to generate a warning rather than an error\
    if a table or DEFINE in an SQL statement does not exist\
    during explicit SQL compilation. If you are using late\
    name resolution and want to use a table or DEFINE that\
    does not exist during explicit SQL compilation, include\
    the -e option. Then at run time, the SQL executor\
    automatically recompiles the SQL statement from the\
    statement's source in the SQL module by using the\
    run-time version of the table. However, to find errors in\
    your program during explicit SQL compilation, omit the\
    -e option.\
    \
  -v causes Compiler to display summary information in addition\
    to error and warning messages for the compilation.\
  -d allows you to specify any Compiler control query default\
    settings at the command line. The command line settings\
    override any corresponding settings in the DEFAULTS table.\
    \
  -g moduleGlobal \
    Causes Compiler to place compiled module(s) into the global\
    /usr/tandem/sqlmx/USERMODULES directory. \
  -g moduleLocal \
    Causes Compiler to place compiled module(s) into the same\
    OSS directory as the <application file>.
