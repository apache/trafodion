  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  // The send and receive queues of a Guardian connection to a server are
  // managed like this:
  // 
  // - Guardian Send operations are started in the order they are
  //   they are called, but may complete in any order.
  // - The send() method places the new message at the end of the send
  //   queue. Buffers in the send queue are not physically sent yet.
  // - If less than <nowait depth> operations are active and if buffers
  //   are in the send queue, send as many as possible, leaving one
  //   possible I/O operation open for out-of-band data.
  // - If a buffer is longer than the max. length for WRITEREADX, then
  //   send it in chunks. The server MUST NOT reply with data to any
  //   chunk. After all chunks are sent, issue a read on
  //   the beginning of the buffer. This completes the send part.
  // - If a buffer is completely sent (immediately if this is a single
  //   chunk message), the send callback is called.
  // - The receive() call by the user looks for a buffer in the receive
  //   queue first. If such a buffer exists, the receive callback is
  //   called and the buffer is removed from the receive queue.
  //   Otherwise, the oldest outstanding receive operation is found
  //   and branded with the receive callback specified in receive().
  // - If an AWAITIOX operation completes, we check whether a partial
  //   buffer has come back. If this is the case, a new READX request
  //   is started immediately to redrive the I/O and read another chunk.
  //   Otherwise, call the receive callback if it has been assigned
  //   already or add the buffer to the receive queue if it doesn't have
  //   a receive callback assigned yet. This means that the receive
  //   queue contains buffers whose I/Os have completed but for which
  //   no receive() call has been issued yet.
