[[arch-overview]]
== Overview   
[[arch-overview-rest]]
=== REST  
The Trafodion REST server, see figure <<img-rest,Figure 1>>, is a process that give access to cluster, nodes,
applications, transactions and ODBC/JDBC Type4 connection information.

The REST server provides the following:  

* A lightweight standalone server. 
* Simple configuration and startup.
* Well known REST API.  
* Embedded Jetty server. 
* Embedded JDBC Type 2/Type 4 driver.
* Embedded ZooKeeper client.
* Automatic script change detection and recompile.
* HTTPS encryption.
* 100% Java implementation.

[[arch-client]]
== Client   
Http clients connect to the server using the default port 4200 for HTTP and 4201 if HTTPS is setup in the embedded
Jetty server.
	
[[arch-trafodionrest]]
== TrafodionRest 
TrafodionRest is the implementation of the server. Using its embedded Jetty server it services Http client 
HTTP and HTTPS requests. It's a 100% java implementation.

[[server-startup]]
=== Startup Behavior 
The server is started/stopped via the scripts found in the _$REST_INSTALL_DIR/bin_ directory. During startup it opens a connection to ZooKeeper.

[[server-threads]]
=== Threads
The server runs several background threads:
         
==== Embedded Jetty 
An link:http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Jetty+Documentation[embedded Jetty] multi-threaded server services all client requests. A default port
is configured but this may be changed in the configuration by modifying the _rest.port_ and _rest.https.port_ properties.
         
[[server-processes-script-manager]]
==== ScriptManager
The script manager thread is responsible for reading and compiling the Python scripts found in _$REST_INSTALL_DIR/bin/scripts_ directory. It  
can detect a change in any script found there. If any script changes it will recompile it.
 
==== JDBC Type 4
An embedded driver is available to execute Trafodion SQL queries by connecting to the DCS service.

==== JDBC Type 2
An embedded driver is available to execute Trafodion SQL queries.
