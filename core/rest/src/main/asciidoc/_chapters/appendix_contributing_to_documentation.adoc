=== Reference Guide Style Guide and Cheat Sheet

This Reference Guide is written in Asciidoc and built using link:http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor]. The following cheat sheet is included for your reference. 
More comprehensive documentation is available in the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual[AsciiDoctor user manual].

| A paragraph | a paragraph | Just type some text with a blank line at the top and bottom.

| In-Line Code or commands | monospace | \`text`  
| In-line literal content (things to be typed exactly as shown) | bold mono | \*\`typethis`*
| In-line replaceable content (things to substitute with your own values) | bold italic mono | \*\_typesomething_*

----

----
(only one colon)
| Link to a remote image | show an image hosted elsewhere | 
----

----
(or `image:`)
| Add dimensions or a URL to the image | depends | inside the brackets after the alt text, specify width, height and/or link="http://my_link.com"

| A complex note | The note has a title and/or multiple paragraphs and/or code blocks or lists, etc |

Here is the note text. Everything until the second set of four equals signs is part of the note.

- [x] Checked (7), at top level
----
| Labelled lists / variablelists | a list item title or summary followed by content | 
----
Title:: content 

Title::
  content
----
| Sidebars, quotes, or other blocks of text | a block of text, formatted differently from the default | Delimited using different delimiters, see http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#built-in-blocks-summary. Some of the examples above use delimiters like \...., ----,====.
........
[example]
====
This is an example block.
====

[source]
----
This is a source block.
----

[note]
====
This is a note block.
====

[quote]
____
This is a quote block.
____
........

If you want to insert literal Asciidoc content that keeps being interpreted, when in doubt, use eight dots as the delimiter at the top and bottom.
| Nested Sections | chapter, section, sub-section, etc | 
----
= Book (or chapter if the chapter can be built alone, see the leveloffset info below)

== Chapter (or section if the chapter is standalone)

=== Section (or subsection, etc)

==== Subsection 
----

and so on up to 6 levels (think carefully about going deeper than 4 levels, maybe you can just titled paragraphs or lists instead). Note that you can include a book inside another book by adding the `:leveloffset:+1` macro directive directly before your include, and resetting it to 0 directly after. See the _index.adoc_ source for examples, as this is how this guide handles chapters. *Don't do it for prefaces, glossaries, appendixes, or other special types of chapters.*

| Include one file from another | Content is included as though it were inline |

----
include::[/path/to/file.adoc]
----

For plenty of examples. see _book.adoc_.
| A table | a table | See http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#tables. Generally rows are separated by newlines and columns by pipes
| Comment out a single line | A  line is skipped during rendering | 
`+//+ This line won't show up`
| Comment out a block | A section of the file is skipped during rendering |
----
////
Nothing between the slashes will show up.
////
----
| Highlight text for review | text shows up with yellow background | 
----
Test between #hash marks# is highlighted yellow.

=== Auto-Generated Content

Some parts of the REST Reference Guide, most notably <<rest_default_configurations,REST default configuration>>, are generated automatically, so that this area of the documentation stays in sync with the code.
This is done by means of an XSLT transform, which you can examine in the source at _src/main/xslt/configuration_to_asciidoc_chapter.xsl_.
This transforms the _rest-common/src/main/resources/rest-default.xml_            file into an Asciidoc output which can be included in the Reference Guide.
Sometimes, it is necessary to add configuration parameters or modify their descriptions.
Make the modifications to the source file, and they will be included in the Reference Guide when it is rebuilt.

It is possible that other types of content can and will be automatically generated from REST source files in the future.


=== Images in the REST Reference Guide

You can include images in the REST Reference Guide. It is important to include an image title if possible, and alternate text always. 
This allows screen readers to navigate to the image and also provides alternative text for the image.
The following is an example of an image with a title and alternate text. Notice the double colon.

[source,asciidoc]
----
.My Image Title
image::sunset.jpg[Alt Text]
----

Here is an example of an inline image with alternate text. Notice the single colon. Inline images cannot have titles. They are generally small images like GUI buttons.

[source,asciidoc]
----
image:sunset.jpg[Alt Text]
----


When doing a local build, save the image to the _src/main/site/resources/images/_ directory.
When you link to the image, do not include the directory portion of the path.
The image will be copied to the appropriate target location during the build of the output.

=== Adding a New Chapter to the REST Reference Guide

If you want to add a new chapter to the REST Reference Guide, the easiest way is to copy an existing chapter file, rename it, and change the ID (in double brackets) and title. Chapters are located in the _src/main/asciidoc/_chapters/_ directory.

Delete the existing content and create the new content.
Then open the _src/main/asciidoc/book.adoc_ file, which is the main file for the REST Reference Guide, and copy an existing `include` element to include your new chapter in the appropriate location.
Be sure to add your new file to your Git repository before creating your patch.

When in doubt, check to see how other files have been included.

=== Common Documentation Issues

The following documentation issues come up often.
Some of these are preferences, but others can create mysterious build errors or other problems.

Syntax Highlighting::
  The REST Reference Guide uses `coderay` for syntax highlighting. To enable syntax highlighting for a given code listing, use the following type of syntax:
+
........
[source,xml]
----
<name>My Name</name>
----
........
+
Several syntax types are supported. The most interesting ones for the REST Reference Guide are `java`, `xml`, `sql`, and `bash`.
