== Logs
The key process logs are as follows...(replace <user> with the user that started the service, <instance> for the server instance and <hostname> for the machine name)
 
* $REST_HOME/logs/rest-<user>-<instance>-rest-<hostname>.log
* $REST_HOME/logs/rest-<user>-<instance>-rest-<hostname>.out

The logs are your best resource when troubleshooting the REST server.
