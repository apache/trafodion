== Quick Start

This chapter describes setup of a Trafodion REST server. It leads you through the starting up and shutting down of your REST server.
The Trafodion installer modifies the configuration files for you and starts/stops the server as part of the Trafodion
_sqstart_ and _sqstop_ scripts so the following sections are for those times when you need a non-standard configuration
or wish to start/stop the server independently.  

Is Trafodion installed and running?

The server presumes a Trafodion instance is installed and running on your machine and available on your path; i.e. the
`MY_SQROOT` environment variable is set and when you type _sqcheck_, you see output that confirms Trafodion is running. If this is not
the case, the server may start but you'll see many errors. 
      
At this point, you are ready to start the server.

=== Starting  

Now start your server:
----     
 $ bin/start-rest.sh 
 starting rest, logging to /logs/rest-user-1-rest-hostname.out
----

You should now have a running server. Logs can be found in the
_logs_ subdirectory. Peruse them especially if the server had trouble starting.

=== Stopping 

Stop your server by running the stop script.
----
 $ ./bin/stop-rest.sh
 stopping rest..
----
