This chapter describes the server configuration. Even though the Trafodion installer prepares the configuration files for you
a thorough read of this chapter will help with non-standard configurations. Please read this chapter carefully and ensure that all 
requirements have been satisfied. Failure to do so will cause you grief debugging strange errors.

Trafodion REST uses the same configuration mechanism as Apache Hadoop.
All configuration files are located in the _conf/_ directory.

[TIP]
====
Be careful editing XML.  Make sure you close all elements. Run your file through +xmllint+ or similar to 
ensure well-formedness of your document after an edit session.
====
 
.Keep Configuration In Sync Across the Cluster
[WARNING]
====
After you make an edit to any configuration file, make sure you copy the content of the _conf_ directory to all nodes of the cluster.
The server will not do this for you. Use +rsync+, +scp+, or another secure mechanism for copying the configuration files to your nodes.
A restart is needed for servers to pick up changes.
====

[[zookeeper]]
== ZooKeeper 

The server depends on a running ZooKeeper cluster to retrieve DCS server, client connection status and metrics.

Set the ensemble servers and client port in _rest-site.xml_ using the `rest.zookeeper.quorum` and `rest.zookeeper.property.clientPort` properties. 
This `rest.zookeeper.quorum` property defaults to a single ensemble member at `localhost`. 

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  ...
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
    <value>2181</value>
    <description>The port at which ZooKeeper server is listening for clients.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>
    host1.example.com,host2.example.com,host3.example.com,host4.example.com,host5.example.com
    </value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost. For a multi-node setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. 
    </description>
  </property>
...
</configuration>

== Configuration Files
         
=== _rest-site.xml_ and _rest-default.xml_
You add site-specific configuration to the file _conf/rest-site.xml_. For the list of configurable properties, 
see <<rest_default_configurations,REST Default Configuration>> below or view the raw _rest-default.xml_ source 
file in the source code at _src/main/resources_.

Not all configuration options make it out to _rest-default.xml_. Configuration
that it is thought rare anyone would change can exist only in code; the only way 
to discover such configurations is via a reading of the source code itself.
      
Currently, changes here will require a restart for the server to notice the change.
      
//The file rest-default.xml is generated as part of the build of the rest site.  See the rest pom.xml.
//The generated file is an asciidoc file.
// rest/src/main/asciidoc
// 
include::../../../../target/asciidoc/rest-default.adoc[]

=== _rest-env.sh_
Set server environment variables in this file. Examples include options to pass the JVM on start of
the server such as heap size and garbarge collector configs. You can also set configurations for server configuration, log directories,
niceness, ssh options, where to locate process pid files, etc. Open the file at _conf/rest-env.sh_ and peruse its content.
Each option is fairly well documented.  Add your own environment variables here if you want them read by the server on startup.
  
Changes here will require a restart for the server to notice the change.
 
=== _log4j.properties_

Edit this file to change rate at which the server log files are rolled and to change the level at which the server logs messages. 

Changes here will require a restart for the server to notice the change.

[[rest.keystore]]
=== _rest-keystore_  
This file will only be present if the property _rest.https.password_ has been set in _conf/rest-site.xml_. 
Please see <<important.configurations,Important Configurations>> for more detail.
      
[[important.configurations]]
== The Important Configurations 
Below we list the *important* Configurations.

=== `rest.port`
The default value is 4200. This is the port the embedded Jetty server binds to
waiting for client HTTP connections. The value may need to be changed
if this port number conflicts with other ports in use on your cluster.
           
To change this configuration, edit _conf/rest-site.xml_, copy the changed file around the cluster and restart.

=== `rest.https.port`
The default value is 4201. This is the port the embedded Jetty server binds to
waiting for client HTTPS connections. The value may need to be changed
if this port number conflicts with other ports in use on your cluster.

=== `rest.ssl.password`
This property is not present by default in _conf/rest-site.xml_. Typically the Trafodion
installer sets this property to an obfuscated password string. If this property is present then the server
will setup HTTPS in the embedded Jetty server. To create an obfuscated password for this property use
the following command:

----
java -classpath $REST_HOME/lib/jetty-9.2.10.v20150310.jar:$REST_HOME/lib/jetty-util-9.2.10.v20150310.jar org.eclipse.jetty.util.security.Password}
----

The output of this command is similar to:
----
OBF:{obfuscated password string}
MD5:{obfuscated password string}
----

Copy/paste the entire string including "OBF:" into this property.
The server will use this property when creating the _/conf/rest-keystore_ directory.
           
To change this configuration, edit _conf/rest-site.xml_, copy the changed file around the cluster and restart.

[TIP]
====
To decrypt the obfuscated string in `rest.ssl.password` do the following:

----
java -classpath $REST_HOME/lib/jetty-9.2.10.v20150310.jar:$REST_HOME/lib/jetty-util-9.2.10.v20150310.jar org.eclipse.jetty.util.security.Password {obfuscated password string}
----

The output of this command is similar to:
----
{your unobfuscated password}
OBF:{obfuscated password string}
MD5:{obfuscated password string}
CRYPT:{obfuscated password string}
----
====

=== `dcs.master.port`
The default value is 37800. This is the port the embedded JDBC Type 4 driver
uses to connect to Trafodion DCS. 

To change this configuration, edit _conf/rest-site.xml_, copy the changed file around the cluster and restart.
