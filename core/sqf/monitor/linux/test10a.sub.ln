!    - connects to server $ABC and reconnects on every send failure
!    - 20 sends to server $ABC with a 1 second delay between sends
!    - 5th and 15th tell server to abort and 20th to exit
!    - between 6th and 15th node down is executed
!   Server $ABC
!    - responds to client server as per above
!    - on 5th abort restarts on node 2
!    - on down node restarts on node 4
!    - on 15th abort restarts on node 4
