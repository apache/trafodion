# Install feature file ($MY_SQROOT/conf/install_features)
#
# This file allows specific Trafodion core builds to signal to
# the installer the presence of a new feature that requires
# configuration work during install time.
#
# This file allows a single installer to install many different
# versions of Trafodion core as opposed to having many versions
# of the installer.  This allows the installer to get additional
# features in ahead of time before the Trafodion core code 
# is available.
#
# The installer will source this file and perform additional
# configuration work based upon the mutually agreed settings
# of the various environment variables in this file.  
#
# It must be coordinated between the Trafodion core feature developer
# and installer developers as to the specifics (i.e. name & value)
# of the environment variable used.
#
# ===========================================================
# Example:
# A new feature requires installer to modify HBase settings in a 
# different way that are not compatible with previous versions of
# Trafodion core. The following is added to this file:
#
#         # support for setting blah-blah in HBase
#         export NEW_HBASE_FEATURE="1"
#
# Logic is added to the installer to test for this env var and if
# there then do the new HBase settings and if not, set the settings
# to whatever they were previously.
# ===========================================================
#

# Trafodion core only works with CDH 5.4 [and HDP 2.3 not yet]
# This env var will signal that to the installer which will
# verify the hadoop distro versions are correct as well as 
# perform some additional support for this.
export CDH_5_3_HDP_2_2_SUPPORT="N"
export CDH_5_4_SUPPORT="Y"
export HDP_2_3_SUPPORT="Y"
