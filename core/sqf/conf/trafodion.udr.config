# Configuration file for TDM_UDRSERV process
# Located at $MY_SQROOT/conf/trafodion.udr.config
# Location of property file can be specified through TRAFUDRCFG env variable
# TRAFUDRCFG will override this default implementation of the property file.
# Properties specfied are passed on to the JVM created by the TDM_UDRSERV
# Can be overridden by env variable TRAF_UDR_JAVA_OPTIONS in 
# $MY_SQROOT/etc/ms.env
# Incorrect property values or specification syntax can result in TDM_UDRSERV
# not being able to initialize a JVM.
# Properties must be specified in a section titled "java".
# Section titles are enclosed in "[" paranthesis.
# For example "[java]"
# Each line contains a separate property.
# Optional comments can follow the property if they are preceeded by a ";".
# Maximum allowed length of a line is 1024 characters.
# For example "-Xmx750m ; max java heap size" is valid (without quotes)
# "-Xmx-750m" is valid
# "-Xmx=750m" is not valid
# "-Xmx750m" /* max java heap size */" is not valid
# The end of a section is indicated with the same line as it's title, i.e. 
# "[java]". The line indicating section end is optional
# At present the only section heading TDM_UDRSERV will process is "[java]"
# Place any required property specfication between the section title and
# end below.
