goall runs all the currently working tests.
NOTE: your PATH must include ".".
NOTE: Make sure that there is no seaquest environment running.
      e.g. sqps - should show 'Environment has not been started!
If the environment is setup correctly, you should be able to 'goall'.

cluster.conf must be setup correctly.

To use goall:
  goall [-cluster] [-verbose]
  options:
    -cluster will run tests in a cluster [otherwise virtual-cluster].
    -verbose will display shell script output.
    if goall is not working correctly, -verbose is recommended.

To run an individual test, e.g. t<number>:
  go<number> [-cluster] [-verbose]
