# Build Dependencies
#
#  This file needs to be copied to ~/.trafodion and updated to override
#    build tool locations
#  .trafodion is sourced in when running $MY_SQROOT/sqenvcom.sh
#    sqenvcom.sh is sourced in by $MY_SQROOT/sqenv.sh
#    sqenv.sh is sourced in by: 
#      $MY_SQROOT/../../env.sh or
#      $MY_SQROOT/sqenvd.sh (debug build) or
#      $MY_SQROOT/sqenvr.sh (release build)
#
#  sqenvcom.sh sets up the environment in preparation for building and
#    running Trafodion.
