README for TRAFCI manualtests
=============================

This directory contains manual tests used to validate fixes for trafci. Eventual goal is to automate these tests.

To run any one specfic test, invoke a trafci session and obey the corresponding test file.

statcheck.sql   - TRAFODION-1765 reported that if statistics are on for a 
                  session, then execution of queries resulted in the following
                  error:
                     "*** ERROR[29003] Statement does not exist"

                  This was a regression due to fix for TRAFODION-1709:

                     When issuing an execdirect sql statement via trafci
                     the statements are not being deallocated. 

                  To check for TRAFODION-1709 do the following while running
                  this test:

                  cd $TRAF_HOME/export/limited-support-tools/LSO 
                  ./offender -s active -t 300

                  For direct execute queries the EXECUTE_STATE should be
                  DEALLOCATED.

                  For prepare/execute queries the EXECUTE_STATE should be
                  CLOSE.
