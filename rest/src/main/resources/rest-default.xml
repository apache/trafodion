  <property>
    <name>rest.tmp.dir</name>
    <value>${java.io.tmpdir}/rest-${user.name}</value>
    <description>Temporary directory on the local filesystem.
    Change this setting to point to a location more permanent
    than '/tmp' (The '/tmp' directory is often cleared on
    machine restart).
    </description>
  </property>  
  <property>
    <name>rest.local.dir</name>
    <value>${rest.tmp.dir}/local/</value>
    <description>Directory on the local filesystem to be used 
    as a local storage.

    <description>The address for the Rest server web UI
    </description>
  </property> 
  <property>
    <name>rest.dns.interface</name>
    <value>default</value>
    <description>Rest uses the local host name for reporting its IP address. If your machine
        has multiple interfaces REST will use the interface that the primary
        host name resolves to. If this is insufficient, you can set this property
        to indicate the primary interface e.g., "eth1". This only works if your cluster 
        configuration is consistent and every host has the same network interface
        configuration.        
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.dns.interface</name>
    <value>default</value>
    <description>The name of the Network Interface from which a ZooKeeper server
      should report its IP address.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.dns.nameserver</name>
    <value>default</value>
    <description>The host name or IP address of the name server (DNS)
      which a ZooKeeper server should use to determine the host name used by the
      master for communication and display purposes.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.server.versionfile.writeattempts</name>
    <value>3</value>
    <description>
    How many time to retry attempting to write a version file
    before just aborting. Each attempt is seperated by the
    rest.server.thread.wakefrequency milliseconds.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>zookeeper.session.timeout</name>
    <value>180000</value>
    <description>ZooKeeper session timeout.
      rest passes this to the zk quorum as suggested maximum time for a
      session (This setting becomes zookeeper's 'maxSessionTimeout').  See
      http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkSessions
      "The client sends a requested timeout, the server responds with the
      timeout that it can give the client. " In milliseconds.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>zookeeper.znode.parent</name>
    <value>/${user.name}</value>
    <description>Root Znode for rest in ZooKeeper. All of rest's ZooKeeper
      znodes that are configured with a relative path will go under this node.
      By default, all of rest's ZooKeeper file path are configured with a
      relative path, so they will all go under this directory unless changed.

  <!--
  The following three properties are used together to create the list of
  host:peer_port:leader_port quorum servers for ZooKeeper.
  -->
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>localhost</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost. For a fully-distributed setup, 
    this should be set to a full list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. 
    If REST_MANAGES_ZK is set in rest-env.sh this is the list of servers which
    we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.peerport</name>
    <value>2888</value>
    <description>Port used by ZooKeeper peers to talk to each other.
    See http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/r3.1.1/zookeeperStarted.html#sc_RunningReplicatedZooKeeper
    for more information.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.leaderport</name>
    <value>3888</value>
    <description>Port used by ZooKeeper for leader election.

    for more information.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.useMulti</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>Instructs rest server to make use of ZooKeeper's multi-update functionality.
    This allows certain ZooKeeper operations to complete more quickly and prevents some issues
    with rare ZooKeeper failure scenarios (see the release note of HBASE-6710 for an example).
    IMPORTANT: only set this to true if all ZooKeeper servers in the cluster are on version 3.4+
    and will not be downgraded.  ZooKeeper versions before 3.4 do not support multi-update and will
    not fail gracefully if multi-update is invoked (see ZOOKEEPER-1495).

  Beginning of properties that are directly mapped from ZooKeeper's zoo.cfg.
  All properties with an "rest.zookeeper.property." prefix are converted for
  ZooKeeper's configuration. Hence, if you want to add an option from zoo.cfg,
  e.g.  "initLimit=10" you would append the following to your configuration:
    <property>
      <name>rest.zookeeper.property.initLimit</name>
      <value>10</value>
    </property>
  -->
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.property.initLimit</name>
    <value>10</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    The number of ticks that the initial synchronization phase can take.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.property.syncLimit</name>
    <value>5</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    The number of ticks that can pass between sending a request and getting an
    acknowledgment.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
    <value>${rest.tmp.dir}/zookeeper</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    The directory where the snapshot is stored.

  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
    <value>2181</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    The port at which the clients will connect.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.zookeeper.property.maxClientCnxns</name>
    <value>300</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    Limit on number of concurrent connections (at the socket level) that a
    single client, identified by IP address, may make to a single member of
    the ZooKeeper ensemble. Set high to avoid zk connection issues running
    standalone and pseudo-distributed.

  <property>
    <name>rest.port</name>
    <value>4200</value>
    <description>The http port for the REST server.</description>
  </property>
   <property>
    <name>rest.https.port</name>
    <value>4201</value>
    <description>The https port for the REST server.</description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.readonly</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>
    Defines the mode the REST server will be started in. Possible values are:
    false: All HTTP methods are permitted - GET/PUT/POST/DELETE.
    true: Only the GET method is permitted.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.threads.max</name>
    <value>100</value>
    <description>
        The maximum number of threads of the REST server thread pool.
        Threads in the pool are reused to process REST requests. This
        controls the maximum number of requests processed concurrently.
        It may help to control the memory used by the REST server to
        avoid out of memory issues. If the thread pool is full, incoming requests
        will be queued up and wait for some free threads. The default
        is 100.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.threads.min</name>
    <value>2</value>
    <description>
        The minimum number of threads of the REST server thread pool.
        The thread pool always has at least these number of threads so
        the REST server is ready to serve incoming requests. The default
        is 2.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>rest.refresh.seconds</name>
    <value>5</value>
    <description>
        Time in seconds between refresh of the REST server page. Set to 0
        to disable automatic refresh. The default is 5.
