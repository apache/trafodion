If you follow the [installation](install.html) instructions, then Trafodion should start up correctly. However, since each system has a somewhat different setup, you may encounter problems during or after an install. 

This page describes how Trafodion objects are set up, what CLASSPATHs and objects are required, and related topics. It also lists common installation problems and their solutions.
