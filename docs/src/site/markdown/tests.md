This page describes how to add or modify Trafodion tests and/or test suites. Please refer to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page for information about other ways to contribute to the Trafodion project.

**Note**: The [Test](testing.html) page describes how the different Trafodion test libraries are organized and how you run different test. You should familiarize yourself with that page before modifying the Trafodion tests.

# SQL Tests
The SQL tests are located in: **```core/sql/regress```**. Please refer to the [Test](testing.html) page for information about each directory. Below, each of these directories is referred to as **```$scriptdir```**.

The default output from **```core/sql/regress/tools/runallsb```** is located in **```$MY_SQROOT/rundir```**. This directory is referred to as **```$rundir```** below.

Files associated with individual tests use the following naming convention: **```\<Type\>\<number\>```**. The files are organized as follows:

Type       | Usage                              | Location
-----------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
TEST       | The test itself.                   | **```$scriptdir/<test suite>```** 
EXPECTED   | The expected output from the test. | **```$scriptdir/<test suite>```**
FILTER     | Filters out variable results (for example, timestamps) from test results to ensure consistent runs. | **```$scriptdir/<test suite>```**
LOG        | The output from running the test.  | **```$rundir/<test suite>```**
DIFF       | Diff between LOG and EXPECTED.     | **```$rundir/<test suite>```**

## Modify a Test
The comments in a test provides information of what it does. Make your changes and then do the following:

* Run the test.
* Verify that the LOG output is as desired.
* Copy the LOG output to EXPECTED.
* Rerun the test and verify that the test passes.

### Output with Variable Data
If there are time stamps or generated names that may vary from run to run or from user to user, then you need to create a ```FILTER\<test number\>``` file. This will filter out the variable portions of the test results so the test results are consistent.
 
Example filter file: **```core/sql/regress/core/FILTER024```**  

**```core/sql/regress/tools```** contains generic filter files. These cover general/common variables in test output. You will need to add a new test specific filer if itâ€™s specific to your new test output only. 

### Check In Changes
Check in the TEST and EXPECTED files in **```$scriptsdir```**.

## Create New Test
Creating a test is just a variation of [Modify a Test](#Modify_a_Test). The test should be associated with a test suite that covers the component you want to test. Please contact the [Trafodion Developer List](mail-lists.html) if you need help chosing the correct test suite.

Once you've chosen the test suite and, therefore, the test source directory, you do the following:

* Add the new test file to the test file in the selected test-suite directory.
    * Use the naming convention found in the directory. (Normally: **```TEST\<nnn\>```**)
    * Refer to **```core/sql/regress/runregr_\<test suite\>.ksh```** to verify the naming convention used.
* The test DDL should use the schema name associated with the test suite.
    * Refer to other test suites for examples.
* Test and validate as described in [Modify a Test](#Modify_a_Test) above. 

## Create New Test Suite
The test suites cover different SQL components. Most components should be covered with the existing test suites.

Do the following to create a new test suite:

* Create a new directory with the suite name under **```core/sql/regress```**; for example: **```\<new test suite\>```**.
* Refer to [Create New Test](#Create_New_Test) for instructions on how to add tests to the new test suite.
* Add a test driver in **```core/sql/regress/tools```** directory with name **```runregr_\<new test suite\>.ksh```**. (Just copy and modify one of the other test drivers.)
* Add the new test suite to **```core/sql/regress/runallsb/TEST_SUBDIRS```**.
