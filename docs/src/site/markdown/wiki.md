This page describes how to change the Trafodion Wiki. Please refer to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page for information about other ways to contribute to the Trafodion project.

# Getting Access

We use a "white-listing" permissions scheme for editing the Wiki. We do this to prevent anonymous spammers from spamming the site.

If you'd like to contribute to the wiki, just obtain a Confluence user ID on the Apache wiki, then send an e-mail to the dev@incubator.trafodion.org dlist requesting access (and providing your Confluence user ID name). 

A friendly administrator will then grant you editing privileges.
