First of all, a big **Thank You** from us for your interest in evaluating and/or using Trafodion. We truly appreciate it! Trafodion exists and continues to improve thanks to you. But you can help us and yourself more!
 
We are a community of volunteers working with the guidelines and policies of the Apache Software Foundation (the Apache Way) in mind. In that spirit, we welcome any kind of input you can provide to create better products. These contributions, whether you think of reporting bugs, supplying code enhancements, making improvements to our documentation, answering questions in our [mailing lists](mail-lists.html), or anywhere else are valuable to everyone. Because each of these helps all of us make Trafodion better.
 
Your first step toward more involvement in our project is to subscribe to one or more of our [mailing lists](mail-lists.html). Next, please consider making your first contribution by simply sending an e-mail to our community discussing; for example:
 
* What you like about Trafodion and its documentation.
* What you find missing.
* An issue you encountered.

Or, help us by writing articles, blog posts, or sharing information about Trafodion at conferences and on social media such as Twitter (\#trafodion).

## Becoming a Registered Contributor
Do you want to be recognized on the [Team page](team-list.html) like many other contributors? If so, please do the following:
 
1. Send an email to the dev mailing list of the project stating that you, as a contributor, want to do more and be listed on the Team page. Any community member with edit permissions to the source code can then add your details to the list. 
2. Send your [**ICLA**](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt) to the secretary of the Apache Software Foundation. Refer to the [Licenses](http://www.apache.org/licenses/) page for information about this requirement. 
 
    As soon as you have your ICLA registration confirmed, inform the community. You can now be added (by designated space admins) to:
 
    * The Trafodion Confluence Contributors group, so that you can add new and edit existing wiki pages.
    * The Trafodion JIRA Contributors group, so that you can assign yourself to any open issue in order to bring it further to resolution and/or closure.
