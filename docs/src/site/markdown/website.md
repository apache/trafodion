This page describes how to change the Trafodion web pages. Please refer to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page for information about other ways to contribute to the Trafodion project.

#Organization

**Source**: **```docs/src```** in the Trafodion source tree.

**Publication:** https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-trafodion-site.git

You develop and test all changes in the Trafodion source tree. Once checked in and built, the content of ```docs/target``` plus different [documentation](document.html) are copied to https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-trafodion-site.git. The changes are then pushed out by Apache gitpubsub, thereby populating http://incubator.trafodion.apache.org.

# Making Changes
The following information helps you understand how to make changes to the web-site content.

----

## Technology

The Trafodion website uses the following technologies:

* **Framework**: [Apache Maven Site](https://maven.apache.org)
* **Skin**: [Reflow Maven Skin](http://andriusvelykis.github.io/reflow-maven-skin/) 
* **Theme**: [Bootswatch Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com/cerulean)
* **Markdown**: [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 

<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">Note</a> **```markdown```** was chosen since it supports inline HTML, which provides better table control than APT. Asciidoc does not work well with the Reflow Maven Skin â€” we tested.

**Note**: Markdown supports basic tables only; that is, you'll need to use ```<table>``` HTML definitions for formatted tables such as cells with bullet lists.

## Code Organization

The code is located in the **```docs```** directory. The code organization follows the [Maven standard](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html).

**```docs/src/site.xml```** is configured per the [Reflow Maven Skin documentation](http://andriusvelykis.github.io/reflow-maven-skin/skin/). Pages and menus are defined and configured in this file. By default, all pages use an automated table of contents; override as needed.

**```docs/src/site/markdown```** contains the files that generate the different HTML files.

**```docs/target```** contains the generated HTML files after you run a build.

## Managing Pages

You add/rename/delete pages in **```docs/src/site/markdown```**. You make corresponding changes in **```docs/src/site.xml```** adding/renaming/deleting pages from menus and defining page configuration; for example: removal of the table of contents bar and the special page formatting provided by the Reflow skin. Refer to the [Maven Documentation](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/sitedescriptor.html) for more information.

## Providing Content

When possible, ensure that you write in active voice and to the point. 

Special functions such as buttons etc. can be access by clicking **Preview** in the theme preview. There's a \<\> feature on each function, which allows you to copy the special **```\<div\>```** you need to insert the selected object.

## Development Environment

Typically, you'll use Eclipse to develop and build the website pages. The configuration goal is: **```clean site```**. The **```pom.xml```** file in the top-level directory drives the build steps for the web site.

## Testing Changes

The website files are located in **```docs/target```**. Open **```index.html```** from your browser and test your changes. For example, you want to validate the page layout, page navigation, links, and review the overall content on the pages you modified or added/deleted.

## Tables
markdown supports a simple format for tables. You can use markdown-style writing in such tables.

    Table Header   | Table Header
    ---------------|---------------
    Text           | Text
    Text           | Text

However, no special formatting can be done; for example, creating a bulleted list in a cell. If you need tables with such formatting, then you will need to define the table in raw HTML format. No markdown-style writing is supported for HTML tables; use pure HTML tagging instead.

## Callout Boxes
You can create a simple callout box using an HTML table. Example:

    <table><tr><td><strong>NOTE</strong><br />Whatever you want to say here.</td></tr></table>

Generates:

<table><tr><td><strong>NOTE</strong><br />Whatever you want to say here.</td></tr></table>

----

# Publishing

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&close;</button>
  <p style="color:black">Publication is done when a committer is ready to update the external web site. You do <strong>not</strong> perform these steps as part of checking in changes.</p></div>

Do the following:

1. Wait for the changes to be committed to the Trafodion master branch.
2. Build Trafodion site (mvn site).
3. If there are documentation changes: Follow the [documentation publishing](document.html#Publishing) instructions.
3. ```git clone``` https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-trafodion-site.git
4. Copy content of ```docs/target``` into the incubator-trafodion-site directory. Commit changes.
5. Push them back to the apache origin repo to the ```asf-site``` branch.

Once pushed, Apache gitpubsub takes care of populating http://incubator.trafodion.apache.org with your new changes.
If they don't show up, pushing another empty (or whitespace change) commit may work to trigger the automation.
