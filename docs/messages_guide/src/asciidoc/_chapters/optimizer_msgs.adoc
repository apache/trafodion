[[SQL-6001]]
== SQL 6001

```
DISTINCT aggregates can be computed for only one column per table expression.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to compute DISTINCT aggregates for more than one
column.

*Effect:* DISTINCT aggregates can be computed only for one column per
table expression.

*Recovery:* Correct syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-6002]]
== SQL 6002

```
The metadata table HISTOGRAMS or HISTOGRAM_INTERVALS contains invalid values. If you have manually modified the metadata table, then you should undo your changes using the CLEAR option in UPDATE STATISTICS.
```

*Cause:* You have manually modified the metadata table, and now it
contains invalid values.

*Effect:* {project-name} is unable to complete
compilation.

*Recovery:* Undo your changes using the CLEAR option in UPDATE
STATISTICS.

<<<
[[SQL-6003]]
== SQL 6003

```
The metadata table HISTOGRAMS or HISTOGRAM_INTERVALS contains invalid boundary value <value> for column <name>. If you have manually modified the metadata table, then you should undo your changes using the CLEAR option in UPDATE STATISTICS.
```

*Cause:* You have manually modified the metadata table, and now it
contains an invalid boundary value.

*Effect:* The {project-name} database uses default histograms to compile the
query. This is a warning message.

*Recovery:* Undo your changes using the CLEAR option in UPDATE
STATISTICS.

[[SQL-6007]]
== SQL 6007

```
Multi-column statistics for columns <names> from table <name> were not available; as a result, the access path chosen might not be the best possible.
```

*Cause:* Statistics are not available for the multicolumn join you are
performing.

This message appears when the user has not updated statistics for column
<names> and when the row count in table <name> is more than the value of
the defaults table constant HIST_ROWCOUNT_REQUIRING_STATS. If you want
to suppress this message, set that value to a very large number, and you
will see this message only for tables with more rows than that, and for
which there are no updated statistics.

*Effect:* None. This is a warning message.

*Recovery:* None.

<<<
[[SQL-6008]]
== SQL 6008

```
Statistics for column <name> were not available. As a result, the access path chosen might not be the best possible.
```

*Cause:* Statistics are not available for the statement you specified.

This message appears when the user has not updated statistics for column
<name> and when the ROWCOUNT in the table is more than the value of the
defaults table constant HIST_ROWCOUNT_REQUIRING_STATS. If you want to
suppress this message, set that value to a very large number, and you
will see this message only for tables with more rows than that, and for
which there are no updated statistics.

*Effect:* None. This is a warning message.

*Recovery:* None.
