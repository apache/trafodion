== SQL 1002

```
Catalog <catalog> does not exist or has not been registered on node <node>.
```

Where <catalog> is the ANSI name of the target catalog.

Where <node> is the node where the process executes.

*Cause:* The catalog is not visible on the local node, either because it
does not exist or because it exists elsewhere on the network but has not
been registered on the local node.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Enter a valid catalog name (or register the catalog on the
node indicated) and resubmit.

[[SQL-1003]]
== SQL 1003

```
Schema <schema> does not exist.
```

Where <schema> is the ANSI name of the affected schema.

*Cause:* In a replication context: a REPLICATION SCHEMA operation
specified a schema that does not exist.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that a schema named <schema> does exist and resubmit.

<<<
[[SQL-1004]]
== SQL 1004

```
Table, view, or stored procedure <object-name> does not exist or object type is invalid for the current operation.
```

Where <object-name> is the name of a {project-name} database object.

*Cause:* You attempted an operation on an object that does not exist.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that an object named <object-name> does exist. If you
did not fully qualify the name, check that the defaults generate the
correct fully qualified name and resubmit.

[[SQL-1005]]
== SQL 1005

```
Constraint <constraint-name> does not exist.
```

Where <constraint-name> is the name of a column constraint or table
constraint.

*Cause:* The ALTER TABLE statement you attempted requires the existence
of a constraint named <constraint-name>.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that a constraint named <constraint-name> exists for
the table specified. You can use the SHOWDDL command to find the names
of the constraints that exist on a table.

<<<
[[SQL-1006]]
== SQL 1006

```
Index <index-name> does not exist.
```

Where <index-name> is a {project-name} database object name.

*Cause:* The operation you attempted requires the existence of an index
named <index-name>.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that an index named <index-name> does exist. If you
did not fully qualify the name, check that the defaults generate the
correct qualified name.

[[SQL-1008]]
== SQL 1008

```
User name <user-name> does not exist.
```

Where <user-name> is a {project-name} platform user name.

that you attempted to grant.

*Recovery:* You must have grant options for privileges to grant them.

<<<
[[SQL-1014]]
== SQL 1014

```
Privileges were not revoked. Dependent privilege descriptors still exist.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to revoke a privilege for a user who has granted
privileges to another user. Privileges must be revoked in reverse order
from how they were granted. If you perform a grant to another user who
then performs a grant to a third user, you cannot revoke privileges to
the second user until that user revokes their privileges to the third
user.

*Effect:* The {project-name} database did not revoke the privileges.

*Recovery:* Make sure that the dependent privileges from the user whose
privileges you want to revoke are revoked first.

[[SQL-1015]]
== SQL 1015

```
Some of the specified privileges could not be revoked.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to revoke a privilege that does not exist or that
was granted by another user.

authorization.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* In a replication context: Only the catalog owner and the
local super ID can perform a replication operation for a catalog and for
multiple schemas in a single catalog. Additionally, the schema owner can
perform a replication operation for a single schema.

<<<
[[SQL-1020]]
== SQL 1020

```

default generates the correct catalog name. Retry the request,
specifying a schema that does not already exist.

[[SQL-1023]]
== SQL 1023

```
Only services ID can name an authorization ID other than the current user name.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to create a schema with the authorization ID of
another user. Only the services ID can do this.

<<<
[[SQL-1024]]
== SQL 1024

```
File system error <error-number> occurred on <text-string-1> <text-string-2>.
```

Where <error-number> is an error originating from the file system.

Where <text-string-1> is the file name.

Where <text-string-2> is (optionally) additional details about the
error.

*Cause:* Look up this error number in the file system manual to
determine the cause.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* For information about file system errors, see <<file_system_errors,File-System Errors>>.

[[SQL-1025]]
== SQL 1025

```
Request failed. One or more dependent objects exist.
```

*Cause:* This error can occur when you drop a constraint, index, or
table. These objects cannot be dropped if they have dependent objects
and the drop-behavior is RESTRICT.

*Effect:* {project-name} does not perform the
operation.

*Recovery:* For DROP statements that support the CASCADE drop-behavior,
you can reissue the statement specifying CASCADE. For other DROP
statements, you must first drop each of the dependent objects, then drop
the object.

<<<
[[SQL-1026]]

DROP SCHEMA statement.

[[SQL-1027]]
== SQL 1027

```
The definition schema <definition-schema-name> is dropped when its catalog is dropped.
```

Where <definition-schema-name> is the name of the definition schema
specified.

*Cause:* You attempted to drop the schema containing the metadata tables
for the catalog.

*Effect:* No SQL objects are dropped.

*Recovery:* Use DROP SCHEMA statements to drop all the user-created
schemas in the catalog. Then use the DROP CATALOG statement to drop the
catalog. The schema <definition-schema-name> is dropped when you drop
its catalog.

<<<
[[SQL-1028]]
== SQL 1028

```
The schema must be empty. It contains at least one object <object-name>.
```

Where <object-name> is the name of a {project-name} database object existing
in the schema.

*Cause:* You attempted to drop a schema that contains one or more
objects.

```

Where <catalog-name> is the name of a {project-name} database catalog.

*Cause:* You attempted to create a catalog using the name of an already
existing catalog.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* None if this is the desired catalog. Otherwise, correct the
catalog name and resubmit.

[[SQL-1036]]
== SQL 1036

```
Only super ID can execute DROP SQL.
```

*Cause:* An attempt was made to drop SQL by a user who is not the super
ID.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* The super ID needs to issue the DROP SCHEMA statement.

<<<
[[SQL-1037]]
== SQL 1037

```
{project-name} is not installed on system <node>.
```

Where <node> is the name of the node referenced by the operation.

```

Where <constraint-name> is the name of a column constraint or table
constraint.

*Cause:* The columns that <constraint-name> references in the referenced
table are not part of a unique constraint.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that <constraint-name> references a unique or primary
constraint in the referenced table.

<<<
[[SQL-1045]]
== SQL 1045

```
The unique constraint cannot be used because it is deferrable.
```

*Cause:* The referential constraint is referencing the unique constraint
that is declared as deferrable. This is an internal error.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check that the referential constraint references a unique
constraint that is not declared deferrable. Contact the {project-name} User
Distribution List

[[SQL-1046]]
== SQL 1046

```
Referenced and referencing column lists do not match for constraint <constraint-name>.
```

Where <constraint-name> is the name of a column constraint or table
constraint.

*Cause:* The list of referencing columns in <constraint-name> does not
match the list of unique key columns that it is referencing.

*Recovery:* Check that the <constraint-name> list of referencing columns
matches the list of referenced columns.

<<<
[[SQL-1047]]
== SQL 1047

```
Request failed. Dependent view <view-name> exists.
```

Where <view-name> is the name of the view on the object being dropped.

*Cause:* An object that has a dependent view cannot be dropped unless
you use the CASCADE option on the DROP statement.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* To drop the object and all its dependent objects, you can
either drop each of the dependent objects using individual DROP
statements before dropping the object itself, or use the CASCADE clause
on the DROP statement for the object.

[[SQL-1048]]
== SQL 1048

```
The statement currently supports only RESTRICT drop behavior.
```

*Cause:* Drop behavior CASCADE was specified on a DROP statement that
supports only RESTRICT drop behavior.

```

*Cause:* You attempted to drop a unique or primary constraint, with
dependent referential constraints, using the RESTRICT option, which does
not remove such constraints.

*Effect:* The drop command fails.

*Recovery:* If you want to drop the dependent referential constraints,
use the CASCADE option for the DROP CONSTRAINT command.

<<<
[[SQL-1051]]
== SQL 1051

```
You do not have the required privilege(s) on <object-name>.
```

Where <object-name> is the name of the object for which you have
insufficient privileges.
