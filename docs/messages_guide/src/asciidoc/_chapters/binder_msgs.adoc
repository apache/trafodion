[[SQL-4001]]
== SQL 4001

```
Column <name-1> is not found. Tables in scope: <name-2>. Default schema: <name-3>.
```

*Cause:* You referenced column <name-1>, which the {project-name} database
software could not find. The table <name-2> or tables in the scope of the
column reference and the default schema <name-3> appear.

A common reason for this error is that you have used double quotes
instead of single quotes. For example:

```
>> SELECT * FROM tb WHERE b > "b";
```

result in this error:

```
*** ERROR[4001] Column "b" is not found. Tables in scope: CAT.SCH.TB. Default schema: CAT.SCH.
```

In this example, the user specified double quotes, which indicate a
delimited identifier, rather than single quotes, which indicate an alpha
literal.

The user probably intended:

```
>> SELECT * FROM tb WHERE b > 'b' ; -- alpha literal or
>> SELECT * FROM tb WHERE b > "v" ; -- table tb (a int, b char, "v" char)
```

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax so that the table and column can be
found, and resubmit.

[[SQL-4002]]
== SQL 4002

```
Column <name-1> is not found. Table <name-2> not exposed. Tables in scope: <name-3>. Default schema: <name-4>.
```

*Cause:* You referenced column <name-1>, which the {project-name} database
software could not find. Table <name-2> is not exposed. The table <name-3>
or tables in the scope of the column reference and the default schema
<name-4> appear.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax so that the table and column can be
found, and resubmit.

[[SQL-4003]]
== SQL 4003

```
Column <name-1> is not a column in table <name-2>, or, after a NATURAL JOIN or JOIN USING, is no longer allowed to be specified with a table correlation name.
```

*Cause:* You either attempted to select column <name-1>, which does not
exist, or referenced a column that is included in a NATURAL JOIN or JOIN
USING and is now a common column. If a column is part of a JOIN
operation, you no longer qualify its name with its original table
<name-2>.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit. If the column is part of a
JOIN, remove the table qualifier and use only the column name.

[[SQL-4004]]
== SQL 4004

```
Column name <name-1> is ambiguous. Tables in scope: <names>. Default schema: <name-2>.
```

*Cause:* You referenced column <name-1>, whose parent table is ambiguous.
The table <names> or tables in the scope of the column reference and
default schema <name-2> appear.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax so that the table's parent table is
clear, and resubmit.

[[SQL-4005]]
== SQL 4005

```
Column reference <name> must be a grouping column or be specified within an aggregate.
```

*Cause:* You referenced column <name>, which is not a grouping column or is not specified within an aggregate, which is not supported.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the column reference and resubmit.

[[SQL-4006]]
== SQL 4006

```
Within an aggregate, all column references must come from the same scope.
```

*Cause:* You referred to columns that do not come from the same scope.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the column references and resubmit.

[[SQL-4007]]
== SQL 4007

```
The select list index <value-1> is out of range. It must be between 1 and the number of select expressions, which in this case is <value-2>.
```

*Cause:* You specified an index <value-1> that is out of the range of
between 1 and the <value-2> of SELECT expressions.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the index and resubmit.

[[SQL-4008]]
== SQL 4008

```
A sub query is not allowed inside an aggregate function.
```

*Cause:* You specified a sub query within an aggregate function, which is
not supported.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

does not exist or is not in scope at this point in the query.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4011]]
== SQL 4011

```
Reference made to column <name> via star (*) is ambiguous.
```

Where <name> is the name of the column.

*Cause:* You referred to column <name> using the `SELECT *` or `SELECT TBL.*`
reference, and the {project-name} database software could not locate the column
because the reference is ambiguous.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4012]]
== SQL 4012

```
Column reference <name> must be a grouping column or be specified within an aggregate. On this grouped table a star reference is not allowed.
```

*Cause:* You referred to column <name> with a SELECT * or SELECT TBL.*
reference. Column <name> must be a grouping column or be specified
within an aggregate.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4013]]
== SQL 4013

```
Column <name> is a system column and cannot be updated or inserted into.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to update or insert into a system column
<name>, which is not supported.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax to refer to a non-system column.

[[SQL-4014]]
== SQL 4014

```

```

*Cause:* You created an INTERSECT with operands of unequal degree. They
must be equal.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4015]]
== SQL 4015

```
Aggregate functions are placed incorrectly: <name>.
```

*Cause:* You used aggregate function <name> on an ungrouped table. For
example, you used an aggregate function in a predicate (WHERE or

an outer scope.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4016]]
== SQL 4016

```
The number of derived columns (<value-1>) must equal the degree of the derived table (<value-2>).
```

*Cause:* You specified a statement in which the number of derived
columns (<value-1>) does not equal the degree of the derived table
(<value-2>). They must be equal.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4017]]
== SQL 4017

```
Derived column name <name> was specified more than once.
```

*Cause:* You specified column <name> more than once.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4018]]
== SQL 4018

```
Rows cannot be deleted from an entry-sequenced table.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to delete rows from an entry-sequenced table,
which is not supported.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4019]]
== SQL 4019

```
The select list of a sub query in a select list must be scalar (degree of one).
```

*Cause:* You specified a select list that is not scalar.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4020]]

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4023]]
== SQL 4023

```
The degree of each row value constructor (<value>) must equal the degree of the target table column list (<value>).
```

*Cause:* You specified a statement, such as INSERT, in which a <row-value> constructor does not equal the degree of the target table column
list. For example:

```
INSERT INTO table (acol, bcol) VALUES (1, 2, 3);
```

is wrong because the number of columns does not match the number of
values.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4024]]
== SQL 4024

```
Column <name> has no default value, so it must be explicitly specified in the insert column list.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to insert column <name> into a table, and the
column has no default value. For example:

```
INSERT INTO table (acol, bcol, ccol) VALUES (1, 2);
```

is wrong if ccol does not have a default value and you did not specify
its value. The column list is optional, but if you use it, you must
explicitly specify values for columns that do not have default values.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4089]]
== SQL 4089

```
Check constraint <name> contains a sub query. This is not yet supported.

[[SQL-4093]]
== SQL 4093

```
The number of output dynamic parameters (<value-1>) must equal the number of selected values (<value-2>).

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4094]]
== SQL 4094

<value-2>.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4095]]
== SQL 4095

```
A DEFAULT whose value is NULL is not allowed in <object-name>.
```

*Cause:* You included a NULL operand in <object-name>, which is not
supported.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4096]]
== SQL 4096

```
A DEFAULT specification is currently allowed only when simply
contained in the VALUES list of an INSERT.
```

*Cause:* You specified a DEFAULT value that was not contained in the
VALUES list of an INSERT.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4097]]
== SQL 4097

```
A NULL operand is not allowed in function <name>.

*Cause:* You attempted to use a NULL operand in function <name>, which
is not supported.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4098]]
== SQL 4098

```
A NULL operand is not allowed in operation <name>.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4100]]
== SQL 4100

```
A NULL value is not allowed in a select list unless it is CAST to some data type.
```

*Cause:* You specified a NULL value in a select list that is not cast to
a data type, which is required.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4101]]
== SQL 4101

```
If <name> is intended to be a further table reference in the FROM
clause, the preceding join search condition must be enclosed in
parentheses.
```

*Cause:* A syntax error has caused the {project-name} database software to
treat object <name> as an ambiguous entity.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Check the syntax for a missing parenthesis and resubmit. If
the object is not intended as a table reference in the FROM clause, use
the error messages that accompany this one to diagnose the problem.
Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4102]]
== SQL 4102

```
The [FIRST/ANY n] syntax can be used only in an outermost SELECT
statement that is not contained in a UNION or INSERT.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to use either a FIRST n or an ANY n clause in
other than an outermost SELECT statement.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Remove the `FIRST n` or `ANY n` clause and resubmit.

[[SQL-4104]]
== SQL 4104

```
If a character literal was intended, you must use the single quote
delimiter: <literal>. The use of double quotes causes {project-name} to
interpret <column-name> as a delimited identifier column name.
```

Where <column-name> is a delimited ANSI identifier, such as MYCOL.

*Cause:* You attempted to select from a table using a character literal,
but you used double quotes as the delimiter instead of single quotes.

For example, if you enter this statement, in which "Lower" is a
character literal:

>>select * from T050a where a="Lower"; you will receive this error:

*** ERROR[4001] Column "Lower" is not found. Tables in scope:
CAT.SCH.T050A. Default schema: CAT.SCH.

*** ERROR[4104] If a character literal was intended, you must use the
single quote delimiter instead of the double: 'Lower' instead of
"Lower".

*Effect:* Nothing is selected.

*Recovery:* Replace the double quotes with single quotes.

[[SQL-4105]]
== SQL 4105

```
Translation name is not recognized.
```

*Cause:* {project-name} does not recognize the
translation name.

*Effect:* {project-name} is unable to compile the
statement.

*Recovery:* Use one of the supported translation names.

[[SQL-4106]]
== SQL 4106

```
The character set for the operand of function <name-1> must be <name-2>.
```

*Cause:* You specified an operand for function <name-1> with the wrong
character set <name-2>.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the character set of the operand and resubmit.

[[SQL-4107]]
== SQL 4107

```
Column <name> has no default value, so DEFAULT cannot be specified.
```

*Cause:* In the source value list of INSERT, you specified DEFAULT for
column <name>, but there is no default value for that column.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4108]]
== SQL 4108

```
Inside a ROWS SINCE, another sequence function contained an invalid
reference to the THIS function.
```

*Cause:* A ROWS SINCE function in your statement contained another
sequence function that, in turn, contained an invalid reference to the
THIS function. Inside ROWS SINCE, the THIS function must not appear
inside any other sequence function.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Reword the query so that the expression inside the other
sequence function does not contain references to the THIS function.

[[SQL-4109]]
== SQL 4109

```
Sequence functions are placed incorrectly: <name>.
```

*Cause:* You specified a query that includes a SEQUENCE BY clause that
contains an illegally placed sequence function <name>. Sequence
functions (such as RUNNINGSUM, MOVINGSUM, LASTNOTNULL) are supported
only in the select list or the HAVING clause of the query expression
containing the SEQUENCE BY clause. For example, these queries are legal:

```
>>select a, runningcount(b) from T1 sequence by a;

>>select x from (select a, runningcount(b) from T1 sequence by a)
T2(x,y) where y > 10;

>>select count(*) from t1 sequence by b group by a having runningsum(a)
> count(*);

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit. For example:

>>select a from T1 where runningcount(b) > 10 sequence by a;

*** ERROR[4109] Sequence functions placed incorrectly:
RUNNINGCOUNT(CAT.SCH.HPPARTEST1.B).

*** ERROR[8822] Unable to prepare the statement.
```

[[SQL-4110]]
== SQL 4110

```
The query contains sequence functions but no SEQUENCE BY clause: <name>.
```

*Cause:* You specified a query that contains a sequence function <name>
but no SEQUENCE BY clause, which is not supported. The value of the
sequence function depends on the specific sequence (order) of the rows.
If no sequence is defined, the result of the sequence function is
dependent on an arbitrary ordering of the rows, which could lead to
unexpected results.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit. For example:

```
>>select runningsum(a) from t1;

*** ERROR[4110] The query contains sequence functions but no SEQUENCE BY clause: RUNNINGSUM(CAT.SCH.T1.A).
```

To correct the query, add a SEQUENCE BY clause:

```
>>select runningsum(a) from t1 sequence by b;
```

[[SQL-4111]]
== SQL 4111

```
The query contains a SEQUENCE BY clause but no sequence functions.
```

*Cause:* You specified a query that contained a SEQUENCE BY clause but
no sequence functions, which is not supported. The purpose of the
SEQUENCE BY clause is to specify an ordering for computing one or more
sequence functions.

Without sequence functions, the SEQUENCE BY clause has no effect.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax by adding a sequence function to the
query or by using an ORDER BY (if you intend to order the result set.)
For example:

```
>>select a from T1 sequence by a;

*** ERROR[4111] The query contains a SEQUENCE BY clause but no sequence functions.

*** ERROR[8822] Unable to prepare the statement.
```

Correct the syntax with one of these:

```
>>select a, runningavg(c) from T1 sequence by a;
>>select a from T1 order by a;
```

[[SQL-4112]]
== SQL 4112

```
Absolute and relative sampling cannot occur in the same BALANCE expression.
```

*Cause:* You attempted to perform absolute and relative sampling in the
same balance expression, which is not supported.

*Effect:* {project-name} is unable to prepare the
query.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4113]]
== SQL 4113

```
The sample size for <type> Sampling must be <size-type>.
```

*Cause:* You specified an invalid combination of sample <type> and
sample <size-type>.

*Effect:* {project-name} is unable to prepare the
query.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4114]]
== SQL 4114

```
An absolute sample size must have a scale of zero.
```

*Cause:* You specified an absolute sample size with a scale greater than
zero, which is not supported.

*Effect:* {project-name} is unable to prepare the
query.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4115]]
== SQL 4115

```
The sample size must be less than or equal to the sample period.
```

*Cause:* You specified a sample size that is greater than the sample
period. It must be less than or equal to the sample period.

*Effect:* {project-name} is unable to prepare the
query.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4116]]
== SQL 4116

```
The second operand of function <name> is not valid.
```

*Cause:* You specified an invalid operand for the second operand of
function <name>. For example, a numeric literal operand (for example,
9999999999999999999) cannot be represented as a valid compile-time
constant value.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit. In this example, you would
replace the numeric literal with a smaller numeric literal operand that
can be represented as a valid compile-time constant value.

[[SQL-4117]]
== SQL 4117

```
The cursor query expression might be nonupdatable.
```

*Cause:* You specified a join or a nonupdatable query in an updatable
cursor query (that is, one with an optional FOR UPDATE OF clause). That
cursor's select list did not select the target column of the update.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* An updatable cursor query should specify the target update
column in the select list of the query. Use the FOR UPDATE OF clause
only if the cursor query is updatable.

This example of a nonupdatable cursor join query does not select the
target of the update and receives an error:

```
>>SELECT A.PROD_CODE FROM EXPRODPARAMS A, MSRATES B
+>WHERE CASE WHEN B.UPDATE_FLAG IS NULL THEN 'N' ELSE
B.UPDATE_FLAG END = 'N'
+>AND A.ACC_TYPE = B.ACC_TYPE AND A.PROD_CODE = B.PROD_CODE
+>FOR UPDATE OF UPDATE_FLAG ;

*** ERROR[4001] Column UPDATE_FLAG is not found. Tables in scope: A.
Default schema: CAT.SCH.

*** ERROR[4117] The cursor query expression may be nonupdatable.

*** ERROR[8822] Unable to prepare the statement. 
```

[[118_The_cursor_query_expression_is_not_updatable]]
== 118 The cursor query expression is not updatable

*Cause:* You specified a join or a nonupdatable query in an updatable
cursor query (that is, one with an optional FOR UPDATE OF clause). A
join query is not updatable.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* An updatable cursor query should not specify a join or a
nonupdatable query. A {project-name} database software statement cursor is
updatable if all the following are true:

* It is a SELECT statement.
* There is only one table reference in the FROM clause, and there are no
correlated subquery references to that table. For example, this query is
updatable:

```
SELECT A FROM T;
```

This one is not: SELECT A FROM T WHERE B = (SELECT C FROM U WHERE T.I. = U.I)

* There are no aggregates.
* There are no GROUP BY, DISTINCT, or ORDER BY clauses.
* All select_list columns are column references.
* No column reference occurs more than once in the select list.

This example of a nonupdatable cursor join query selects the target of
the update correctly and receives an error:

```
>>SELECT A.PROD_CODE, B.UPDATE_FLAG FROM EXPRODPARAMS A, MSRATES B
+>WHERE CASE WHEN B.UPDATE_FLAG IS NULL THEN 'N' ELSE B.UPDATE_FLAG END = 'N'
+>AND A.ACC_TYPE = B.ACC_TYPE AND A.PROD_CODE = B.PROD_CODE
+>FOR UPDATE OF UPDATE_FLAG ;

In a query with a GROUP BY, DISTINCT, or aggregate function, each
```
column in the ORDER BY clause must be one of the columns explicitly
SELECTed by the query. Column in error: <name>.

*Cause:* You attempted to perform a query with an aggregate function, a
GROUP BY clause, or a DISTINCT clause. A column in the ORDER BY clause,
<name>, is not one of the columns explicitly selected by the query.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the ORDER BY clause and resubmit.

```
The select list of a sub query in a row value constructor must be
scalar (degree of one) if the sub query is one of several expressions
rather than the only expression in the constructor.
```

*Cause:* You specified a subquery, consisting of several expressions,
whose select list is not scalar. If the subquery is not the only
expression in the constructor, it must be scalar.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4126]]

its ELSE statement list.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-4130]]

[[SQL-4135]]
== SQL 4135

```
In an INSERT-SELECT, each column in the ORDER BY clause must be one
of the columns in the selected list of the query. Column in error: B.
```

*Cause:* You tried to SQL-compile an INSERT-SELECT statement that
specified an ORDER BY column that is not in the select list of the

*Recovery:* Use a [LAST 1] clause in the outer SELECT.

[[SQL-4150]]
== SQL 4150

```
Primary key of table expression <name> must be used for join with
embedded <operation> expression. Tables in scope: <name>.
```

*Cause:* You performed an embedded DELETE or UPDATE and are now
attempting to join the result set of whatever that operation was with
the result set of another expression. You did not use the primary key of
the second expression for your join. You must use the primary key to
prevent returning multiple rows being returned for a single deleted or
updated row.

*Effect:* {project-name} is unable to compile the
statement.
