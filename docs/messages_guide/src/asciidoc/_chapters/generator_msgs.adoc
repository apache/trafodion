[[SQL-7001]]
== SQL 7001

```

for column <name>.

*Effect:* The operation fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

[[SQL-7003]]
== SQL 7003

```
A plan using cluster sampling could not be produced for this query.
```

*Cause:* You can use cluster sampling in a query only on a base table
result set and only if there is no WHERE clause in the SELECT statement.
This query does not satisfy these conditions.

*Effect:* Trafodion is unable to compile the query.

*Recovery:* Rewrite the query (for example, using nested queries) so
that cluster sampling is performed on a base table with no WHERE-clause
predicate.
