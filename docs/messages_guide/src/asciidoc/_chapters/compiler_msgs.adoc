== SQL 2050

```
<attribute> is not the name of any DEFAULTS table attribute.
```

Where <attribute> is the attribute name you specified.

*Cause:* If the SQLSTATE is 42000, this is an error. You attempted to
set a CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT setting, but the <attribute> name you
specified is not valid. If the SQLSTATE is 01000, this is a warning. In an earlier {project-name}
database session, you inserted a row into a DEFAULTS table whose
<attribute> column value is invalid.

*Effect:* If this is an error, the operation fails. If this is a
warning, this is an informational message.

*Recovery:* Correct the attribute name and resubmit.

<<<
[[SQL-2051]]

[[SQL-2053]]
== SQL 2053

```
Optimizer pass two assertion failure (<failure-text>) in file <filename> at line <line-num>.
```

*Cause:* This is an informational message that is a result of the
two-pass mechanism of the optimizer. The optimizer created a simple
plan, and then while refining that plan, an internal error occurred, so
the simple plan was not improved. The simple plan is still valid and
will work.

*Effect:* Your query will use the original, simple plan.

*Recovery:* Informational message only; no corrective action is needed.
This message will be accompanied by an assertion failure message and,
possibly, CONTROL QUERY SHAPE information. However, report the entire
message, and the preceding assertion failure message, to {project-support}.

This additional information will also be helpful: the DDL for the tables
involved, the query that produced this warning, and any CONTROL QUERY
SHAPE and CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT settings in effect when the error
occurred.

<<<
[[SQL-2054]]
== SQL 2054

```
HIST_NO_STATS_ROWCOUNT should always be greater than or equal to CQD HIST_NO_STATS_UEC. Present value of HIST_NO_STATS_UEC is '<value>'.
```

less than the current value of CQD HIST_NO_STATS_UEC.

*Effect:* The current value of the HIST_NO_STATS_ROWCOUNT is retained.

*Recovery:* Set the value of CQD HIST_NO_STATS_ROWCOUNT greater than or
equal to the value of HIST_NO_STATS_UEC. If you want to use a smaller
value, reduce the value of CQD HIST_NO_STATS_UEC first. Note that any
change in either of the two values can have an effect on the plan
quality.

[[SQL-2055]]
== SQL 2055
