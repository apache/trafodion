[[sqlstate]]
= SQLSTATE 

{project-name} returns SQLSTATE values that are defined
in the ISO/ANSI SQL standard and implementation-defined SQLSTATE values. See
Subclause 22, "Status Codes" in the ISO/ANSI SQL92 Standard "Database
Language SQL."

[[sqlstate-and-sqlcode-considerations]]
== SQLSTATE and SQLCODE Considerations

* Using SQLSTATE causes performance overhead because of the representation of SQLSTATE as five characters. 
The overhead is most noticeable with short SQL statements and in error situations.

* Mapping SQLSTATE values to SQLCODE values can result in ambiguous SQLCODE values:

** SQLCODE values will often not map to a unique SQLSTATE value. For example, see the many SQLCODE 
values mapped to SQLSTATE 42000 in the table below.

** To deal with the problem of ambiguous SQLCODE values, we recommends retrieving the error message 
text or the SQLCODE value in addition to the SQLSTATE.

* SQLSTATE values for some {project-name} error and warning messages might be subject to change:

** In the future, {project-name} might return different SQLSTATE values for error conditions than it does now.

** In the future, the {project-name} error handling might use a different error path, and therefore return a 
slightly different SQLCODE and implementation defined SQLSTATE value for an error.

[[sqlstate-values]]
== SQLSTATE Values

The table below is a list of returned SQLSTATE values ordered by SQLSTATE.
SQLSTATE values are provided for both warning messages (positive SQLCODE
numbers) and error messages (negative SQLCODE numbers).
