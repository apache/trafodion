= File-System Errors

Some error messages generated by the {project-name} platform include file-system error
codes. For example:

====
*SQL 1024*

```
File system error <error-number> occurred on <text-string-1>. <text-string-2>.
```
====

This section lists all file-system error codes and provides the corresponding error text
for each code number. The error text can sometimes help you troubleshoot a problem.
If the initial error message and file-system error text are insufficient to help you solve a
problem, or if you need more information, 
contact {project-support}.
