= Introduction

== Message Handling

{project-name} reports exception condition messages at a {project-name} Database
Connectivity Service conversational interface (DCS) window and in the
Trafodion Command Interface (TrafCI).

Most {project-name}  exception condition messages describe error conditions
for which recovery action is required. Some messages are warnings that
provide information for which no action is required.

Error messages that appear in response to SQL commands are logged to the
DCS application's log file if you have used the LOG command to request
them.

The format of a {project-name}  error is "*** ERROR" followed by the error number
in brackets, and the descriptive text. Use the error number shown to find
information about a particular error in this manual. For example, information
for {project-name} error 1125 can be found under "SQL 1125."

Messages are listed in this manual in numeric order, broken down by the component
that produced them.

== Viewing {project-name} Database Messages

The message key is a sequential SQL message number that is returned
automatically by {project-name}  when an exception condition
occurs. For example, the following message might be displayed within
your application development tool while you prepare an embedded SQL
program:

```
*** ERROR[1000] A syntax error occurred.
```

<<<
This message number is the SQLCODE value (without the sign). In this
manual, you will find the following message information for ERROR[1000]:

====
*SQL 1000*

1000 A syntax error occurred.

*Cause:* You specified a statement with incorrect syntax.

*Effect:* The {project-name}  statement fails.

*Recovery:* Correct the syntax and resubmit.

== SQLSTATE and SQLCODE

SQLSTATE and SQLCODE status codes are returned to indicate either that
an SQL statement completed successfully or that an exception condition
was raised during execution of an SQL statement.

The ANSI SQL SQLSTATE variable is a five-character string with a
two-character class code followed by a three-character subclass code. An
SQLSTATE value of 00000 indicates successful completion.

{project-name} extends the ANSI SQL SQLSTATE values to include other situations
not described by the ANSI values. If an ANSI SQL SQLSTATE value exists for
an error condition, the {project-name} database software returns that value.
Otherwise, {project-name} returns an SQLSTATE value that is defined by the {project-name}
database software.

{project-name} also returns a numeric SQLCODE value after SQL statement execution.
SQLCODE values with negative numbers signify errors.

SQLCODE values with positive numbers other than 0 (successful completion) or 100
(no data was found) signify warning messages. {project-name}  identifies all messages
by their unsigned SQLCODE value and their calculated SQLSTATE value. The SQLCODE
is used to calculate the SQLSTATE value for all {project-name} messages other than
those for which an ANSI SQL SQLSTATE value exists.

The SQLCODE parameter is a deprecated feature that is supported to
maintain compatibility with earlier versions of the American standard.

<<sqlstate-values,_SQLSTATE Values_>> identifies the equivalent SQLSTATE and
SQLCODE values for {project-name}  warning and error messages.
