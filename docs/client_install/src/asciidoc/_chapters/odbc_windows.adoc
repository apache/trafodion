WARNING: License issues prevent us from including the ODBC Driver for Windows in this release. Contact the
{project-name} user e-mail list ({project-support}) for help obtaining the driver.

If you have not done so already, please ensure that you have unpackaged the
<<download-software, unpackaged the {project-name} client software>>.

The examples in this chapter assumes that you have unpackaged the installation files
to `c:\trafodion\odbc`.

== Installation Instructions

NOTE: To install the driver on your PC, you must be logged on with a user ID that has administrator privileges.

The ODBC client installation file (`c:\trafodion\odbc\TFODBC64-*.exe`) installs or links to
multiple client components:

[cols="40%s,60%",options="header"]
|===
| This client component&#8230; | Does this&#8230;
| Microsoft ODBC Driver Manager | Manages access to ODBC drivers for applications. The driver manager loads and unloads drivers and passes calls for ODBC functions to the
correct driver.
| Trafodion ODBC driver | Implements ODBC function calls to enable an ODBC client application to access the {project-name} database.
| Microsoft ODBC Administrator | Adds, configures, and removes ODBC data sources on client workstations.
|===

By default, a new version of the ODBC driver is installed in this directory and its folders unless you specify a different directory
during installation:

[cols="40%l,60%",options="header"]
|===
| Default Installation Directory    | Client Operating System
| C:\Program Files\Trafodion\TRAF   | ODBC _version_ Windows 64-bit

=== Enable Compression
When compression is enabled in the ODBC driver, the ODBC driver can send and receive large volumes of data quickly and efficiently to and from
the {project-name} Database Connectivity Services (DCS) server over a TCP/IP network. By default, compression is disabled.

To enable compression in the ODBC driver or to change the compression setting, follow these steps:

1.  Launch the MS ODBC Administrator. 
* On Windows 7: *Start > All Programs > {project-name} ODBC _version_ > MS ODBC Administrator*
* On Windows 8: *Start > Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools > ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)*
* On Windows 10: Right-click the Windows icon in the menu bar. Select *Control Panel*. Search for *Set up ODBC data sources (64-bit)*. Click on the found item. 

2.  In the *ODBC Data Source Administrator* dialog box, select the *User DSN* tab, select the name of your data source under 
*User Data Sources*, and click *Configure*. If you did not create a data source, please refer to 
<<win_odbc_client_env, Setting Up the Client Environment>>.
+
A new dialog box appears, showing the configuration of your data source.

3.  Select the *Network* tab, and then select one of these values for *Compression*:
* `SYSTEM_DEFAULT`, which is the same as no compression
* `no compression`
* `best speed`
* `best compression`
* `balance`
* An integer from 0 to 9, with 0 being no compression and 9 being the
maximum available compression
4.  Click *OK* to accept the change.
5.  Click *OK* to exit the *ODBC Data Source Administrator* dialog box.

<<<
[[win_odbc_run_basicsql]]
== Run Sample Program (`basicsql`)
NOTE: The Basic SQL sample program is not currently bundled with the ODBC Windows driver. To obtain the source code and the build and run
files for this program, please refer to  <<odbc_sample_program, ODBC Sample Program>>.

To build and run the executable file, follow these steps:

1.  Open a Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt. Make sure to select the x64 version of the command prompt. For example, on Windows 7, select
*Start>All Programs>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010>Visual Studio Tools>Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt*.
2.  At the command prompt, move to the directory where you put the `basicsql.cpp` and build files.
3.  Run build at the command prompt. You will see `basicsql.exe` created in the same directory as the source file.
4.  Before running the sample program, create a {project-name} data source named `Default_DataSource` on the client workstation using MS ODBC
Administrator. For instructions, please refer to <<win_odbc_client_env,Set Up Client Environment>>.
5.  From the command prompt, run the sample program by entering either run or this command:
+
```
basicsql DefaultDataSource <username> <password>
```
+
If the sample program executes successfully, you should see this output:
+
*Example*
+
```
Using Connect String: DSN=Default_DataSource;UID=user1;PWD=pwd1;
Successfully connected using SQLDriverConnect.
Drop sample table if it exists...
Creating sample table TASKS...
Table TASKS created using SQLExecDirect.
Inserting data using SQLBindParameter, SQLPrepare, SQLExecute
Data inserted.
Fetching data using SQLExecDirect, SQLFetch, SQLGetData
Data selected: 1000 CREATE REPORTS 2014-3-22
Basic SQL ODBC Test Passed!
```

<<<
== Reinstall Windows ODBC Driver
To reinstall the driver, we recommend that you fully remove your ODBC driver and then install the new version. Please refer to
<<win_odbc_uninstall,Uninstalling the {project-name} ODBC Driver for Windows>> and then <<win_odbc_install, Installing the {project-name} ODBC Driver for Windows>>.

[[win_odbc_uninstall]]
== Uninstalling Windows ODBC Driver
1.  Start to remove the ODBC driver:
* On Windows 7: *Start > All Programs>{project-name} ODBC _version_ > Remove TRAF ODBC _version_*
* On Windows 8: *Start* > *Control Panel* > *Uninstall a program* > Locate *{project-name} ODBC64 _version_* > *Uninstall {project-name} ODBC64 _version_*
* On Windows 10: Right-click the Windows icon in the menu bar. Select *Control Panel*. Click on *Apps and features*. Locate *{project-name} ODBC64 _version_* and right-click it. Select *Uninstall*.

2.  When the *Windows Installer* dialog box asks you if you want to uninstall this product, click *Yes*.
3.  The *{project-name} ODBC _version_* dialog box displays the status and asks you to wait while `Windows configures {project-name} ODBC _version_` (that is, removes
the {project-name} ODBC Driver from your Windows workstation).
+
After this dialog box disappears, {project-name} ODBC _version_ is no longer on your workstation.

NOTE: Uninstalling the ODBC driver does not remove pre-existing data source definitions from the Windows registry.
