|===
| Default Installation Directory    | Client Operating System
| C:\Program Files\Trafodion\TRAF   | ODBC _version_ Windows 64-bit
|===

=== Start the InstallShield wizard
The InstallShield wizard walks you through the steps to install the client components ({project-name} ODBC 1.0) on your workstation. You can
perform the installation in _interactive mode_, in which you provide input or accept defaults when prompted as ODBC is installed. 
Please refer to <<win_odbc_interactive_mode,Interactive Mode Installation>> below.

[[win_odbc_interactive_mode]]
==== Interactive Mode Installation

1.  Double-click the `TFODBC64-*.exe` distribution file to start the InstallShield wizard.

7.  Enter the translate DLL name and its option, if you have one. If not, leave it blank. Leave the localization defaults as is.
+
The Replacement Character replaces any character that is incompatible for translation when retrieving data. It is one character (one or two
bytes long). The Replacement Character is assumed to be in the character set specified in the Client/Server Character Set Interaction. If it is not specified, `?` is used as the default.
+
Click *Finish*.

8.  The wizard gives you an opportunity to test the connection. Click *Test Connection* and click *OK*.
9.  The server ID and schema are filled in for you. Enter a valid user name and password, and click *OK*.
+
The wizard attempts to connect to the data source and displays a message stating whether it was successful or not.
10.  Click *OK* to save the data source, or click *Cancel* _twice_ to quit the *Create Data Source* wizard.

^1^ Your specific installation may use a different port number. Check with your {project-name} administrator.

<<<
[[win_odbc_client_env]]
=== Set Up Client Environment
All client data sources connect to the pre-configured server data source on the database platform, which is `Default_DataSource`. 

You can configure one data source only, `Default_DataSource`, on the database platform, but you can create other data source 
definitions on the workstation. 

For example, if you have more than one schema on the database platform and you want to connect 
to each of those schemas on the database platform, you can create a client data source for each of those schemas. 

Instead of changing the schema definition in the data source definition on the workstation, you can create multiple data source 
definitions with different schemas on the workstation. The client data source will use the specified schema but will connect to 
`Default_DataSource` on the database platform.

To create a data source on the client workstation, follow these steps:

1.  Launch the *MS ODBC Administrator*. 
* On Windows 7: *Start>All Programs>{project-name} ODBC _version_>MS ODBC Administrator*
* On Windows 8: Right-click the *{project-name} ODBC _version_* icon on the desktop and select MS ODBC Administrator.
* On Windows 10: Right-click the Windows icon in the menu bar. Select *Settings*. Search for *Set up ODBC data sources (64-bit)*. Click on the found item. 

2.  In the *ODBC Data Source Administrator* dialog box, select the *User DSN* tab, and click *Add*.
3.  Select the *TRAF ODBC _version_* driver, and then click *Finish*.
+
A new dialog box appears, prompting you to create a new data source.
4.  Enter the name of the data source, `Default_DataSource`, and click *Next* to continue.
5.  Enter the IP address and port number of the {project-name} system to which will be connecting. By default, the port number is *23400*^1^. 
Click *Next* to continue.
6.  Select the default schema. If you do not select a schema, the default is `SEABASE`. Click *Next* to continue.
+
<<<
7.  If desired, configure the *translate dll*, which translates data from one character set to another, and configure the localization. By
default, the client error message language is English, and the clientâ€™s local character set is used. Click *Finish* to continue.
+
The *Test {project-name} ODBC Connection* dialog box appears, allowing you to test the connection using the data source that you created.

8.  Click *Test Connection*.
9.  When prompted, enter your user name and password, and, optionally, schema. Click *OK*.
+
If the connection is successful, you will see `Connected Successfully` in the *Test {project-name} ODBC Connection* dialog box.
10.  Click *OK* to save the data source, or click *Cancel* _twice_ to quit the *Create Data Source* wizard.

^1^ Your specific installation may use a different port number. Check with your {project-name} administrator.

=== Enable Compression
When compression is enabled in the ODBC driver, the ODBC driver can send and receive large volumes of data quickly and efficiently to and from
the {project-name} Database Connectivity Services (DCS) server over a TCP/IP network. By default, compression is disabled.

To enable compression in the ODBC driver or to change the compression setting, follow these steps:

1.  Launch the MS ODBC Administrator. 
* On Windows 7: *Start>All Programs>{project-name} ODBC _version_>MS ODBC Administrator*
* On Windows 8: Right-click the *{project-name} ODBC _version_* icon on the desktop and select MS ODBC Administrator.
* On Windows 10: Right-click the Windows icon in the menu bar. Select *Settings*. Search for *Set up ODBC data sources (64-bit)*. Click on the found item. 

2.  In the *ODBC Data Source Administrator* dialog box, select the *User DSN* tab, select the name of your data source under 
*User Data Sources*, and click *Configure*. If you did not create a data source, please refer to 
<<win_odbc_client_env, Setting Up the Client Environment>>.
+
A new dialog box appears, showing the configuration of your data source.
+
<<<
3.  Select the *Network* tab, and then select one of these values for *Compression*:
* `SYSTEM_DEFAULT`, which is the same as no compression
* `no compression`
* `best speed`
* `best compression`
* `balance`
* An integer from 0 to 9, with 0 being no compression and 9 being the
maximum available compression
4.  Click *OK* to accept the change.
5.  Click *OK* to exit the *ODBC Data Source Administrator* dialog box.

<<<
[[win_odbc_run_basicsql]]
=== Run Sample Program (`basicsql`)
NOTE: The Basic SQL sample program is not currently bundled with the ODBC Windows driver. To obtain the source code and the build and run
files for this program, please refer to  <<odbc_sample_program, ODBC Sample Program>>.

To build and run the executable file, follow these steps:

1.  Open a Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt. Make sure to select the x64 version of the command prompt. For example, on Windows 7, select
*Start>All Programs>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010>Visual Studio Tools>Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt*.
2.  At the command prompt, move to the directory where you put the `basicsql.cpp` and build files.
3.  Run build at the command prompt. You will see `basicsql.exe` created in the same directory as the source file.
4.  Before running the sample program, create a {project-name} data source named `Default_DataSource` on the client workstation using MS ODBC
Administrator. For instructions, please refer to <<win_odbc_client_env,Set Up Client Environment>>.
5.  From the command prompt, run the sample program by entering either run or this command:
+
```
basicsql DefaultDataSource <username> <password>
```
+
If the sample program executes successfully, you should see this output:
+
*Example*
+
```

== Reinstall Windows ODBC Driver
To reinstall the driver, we recommend that you fully remove your ODBC driver and then install the new version. Please refer to
<<win_odbc_uninstall,Uninstalling the {project-name} ODBC Driver for Windows>> and then <<win_odbc_install, Installing the {project-name} ODBC Driver for Windows>>.

[[win_odbc_uninstall]]
== Uninstalling Windows ODBC Driver
1.  Start to remove the ODBC driver:
* On Windows 7: *Start>All Programs>{project-name} ODBC _version_>Remove TRAF ODBC _version_*
* On Windows 8: Right-click the *{project-name} ODBC _version_* icon on the desktop and select *Remove TRAF ODBC _version_*.
* On Windows 10: Right-click the Windows icon in the menu bar. Select *Control Panel*. Click on *Uninstall a program*. Locate *{project-name} ODBC64 _version_* and select it. Click on *Uninstall*.

2.  When the *Windows Installer* dialog box asks you if you want to uninstall this product, click *Yes*.
3.  The *{project-name} ODBC _version_* dialog box displays the status and asks you to wait while `Windows configures {project-name} ODBC _version_` (that is, removes
the {project-name} ODBC Driver from your Windows workstation).
+
After this dialog box disappears, {project-name} ODBC _version_ is no longer on your workstation.

NOTE: Uninstalling the ODBC driver does not remove pre-existing data source definitions from the Windows registry.
