= Install Linux ODBC Driver

== Installation Requirements

The driver for Linux requires `libgcc 3.4.3` and `libstd++ 6.0`.

If you are building ODBC applications, please use the preferred build platform, RedHat 6.x or CentOS 6.x.

== Installation Instructions

You download and extract the {project-name} client package using the instructions in <<introduction-download, Download Installation Package>> above.

The package file contains the {project-name} ODBC distribution file, `TRAF_ODBC_Linux_Driver_64.tar.gz`, which is extracted to the `clients` subdirectory.
It contains the following files:

```
connect_test.cpp 
install.sh 
libicudataNv44.so.44 
libicuucNv44.so.44 
libtrafodbc_l64.so 
libtrafodbc_l64_drvr.so 
LICENSE 
license.txt 
MD5SUM 
TRAFDSN 
```

By default, a new version of the {project-name} ODBC driver is installed in the following directories unless you specify a different directory
during installation:

* `/usr/lib64`
* `/etc/odbc`

NOTE: The following header files are not packaged with the {project-name} ODBC driver: +
 +
- `sql.h` +
- `sqlext.h` +
- `sqltypes.h` +
- `sqlucode.h` +
 +
To install those header files, <<win_odbc_client_env, Setting Up the Client Environment>>..

=== Install/Reinstall Linux ODBC Driver

NOTE: You must have root access to install the {project-name} ODBC Driver for Linux at the default system location.

1.  Change the directory to the clients subdirectory, and decompress the `.tar.gz` distribution file:
+
```
gunzip TRAF_ODBC_Linux_Driver_64.tar.gz
```
2.  Extract the contents of the `.tar` file. A directory called `PkgTmp` is created.
+
```
tar â€“xvf TRAF_ODBC_Linux_Driver_64.tar
```

3.  Install the product by entering these commands:
+
```
cd PkgTmp 
sudo ./install.sh
```
+
Except for the sample file, the `install.sh` script saves a copy (`.SAV`) of your previous installation files if they exist.
4.  Accept the terms of the license agreement by entering *yes*.
5.  Enter a directory for the library files, or press Enter to use the default directory (`/usr/lib64`).
6.  Enter a directory for the data-source template file, or press *Enter* to use the default directory (`/etc/odbc`).
7.  Enter a directory for the sample program, or press *Enter* to use the default directory (`/etc/odbc`).

<<<
=== Set Up Client Environment

If you selected default options during installation, ensure that:

* The libraries are located in the `/usr/lib64` directory.
* A `TRAFDSN` file is in the `/etc/odbc` directory.

If you select non-default locations during installation, ensure that the files are installed in the directories that you specified during
installation.

The driver expects the `TRAFDSN` file to be present in either the default location (`/etc/odbc`) or the current working directory (`CWD`) of the
application.

If you are building ODBC applications, you need to install these header files in your build environment:

* `sql.h`
* `sqlext.h`
* `sqltypes.h`
* `sqlucode.h`

To install those header files from the latest packages, run this `yum` command:

```
sudo yum -y install libiodbc libiodbc-devel
```

The `yum` command automatically installs the header files in the `/usr/include` and `/usr/include/libiodbc` directories.

<<<
=== Enable Compression

When compression is enabled in the ODBC driver, the ODBC driver can send and receive large volumes of data quickly and efficiently to and from
the {project-name} Database Connectivity Services (DCS) server over a TCP/IP network. By default, compression is disabled.

To enable compression in the ODBC driver or to change the compression setting, follow these steps:

* If you are using the {project-name} ODBC driver manager, add
+
```
Compression = compression-level
```
+
to the `DSN` section of `TRAFDSN` file.

* If you are using a third-party driver manager, such as unixODBC, add
+
```
Compression = compression-level
```
+
to the `DSN` section of the `odbc.ini` file.

The `_compression-level_` is one of these values:

* `SYSTEM_DEFAULT`, which is the same as no compression
* `no compression`
* `best speed`
* `best compression`
* `balance`
* An integer from `0` to `9`, with `0` being `no compression` and `9` being the `maximum available compression`

<<<
=== Use Third-Party Driver Manager

NOTE: For better performance, we recommend that you use at least version `2.3._x_` of unixODBC.

* If you are using an external driver manager, then you must point to `libtrafodbc_drvr64.so` and not to `libtrafodbc64.so`.
* The driver, `libtrafodbc_l64_drvr.so`, has been verified with iODBC and unixODBC driver managers.
* These driver managers, as well as documentation, can be found at these Web sites:
* http://www.iodbc.org/
* http://www.unixodbc.org/
* For information on the necessary data-source configuration options, you will need to add to the respective configuration files (for example,
to `odbc.ini`).

<<<
=== Run Sample Program (`connect_test`)

NOTE: The examples after each step assume that you have default installation directories.

If you have a previous version of the {project-name} ODBC driver installed, you need to re-link your existing application to ensure that you pick up
the correct version of the driver. If you are unsure of the version, check the version of your application with this command:

```
ldd object-file
```

1.  Move to the directory where you installed the sample program:
+
```
cd /etc/odbc
```

2.  Set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
+
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-odbc-library-files or /usr/lib64>
```
+
*Example*
+
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64
```

3.  In the `/etc/odbc/TRAFDSN` file, add the correct IP address to the `Server` parameter for the `Default_DataSource`.
+
*Example*
+
```
[Default_DataSource]
Description = Default Data Source
Catalog = TRAFODION
Schema = SEABASE
DataLang = 0
FetchBufferSize = SYSTEM_DEFAULT
Server = TCP:1.2.3.4:23400 <- _Set IP Address_
SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = SYSTEM_DEFAULT
SQL_LOGIN_TIMEOUT = SYSTEM_DEFAULT
SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT = NO_TIMEOUT
```
+
<<<

4.  Compile the sample program.
+
```
sudo g++ -g connect_test.cpp -L/usr/lib64 -I/usr/include/odbc -ltrafodbc64 -o connect_test
```

5.  Run the sample program:
+
```
./connect_test -d Default_DataSource -u username -p password
```

If the sample program runs successfully, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Using Connect String: DSN=Default_DataSource;UID=username;PWD=****;
Connect Test Passed...
```

<<<
[[linux_odbc_run_basicsql]]
=== Run Sample Program (`basicsql`)

NOTE: The Basic SQL sample program is not currently bundled with the ODBC Linux driver. To obtain the source code for this program, see
<<odbc_sample_program, `basicsql` (Sample ODBC Program)>>.

If you have a previous version of the {project-name} ODBC driver installed, you need to re-link your existing application to ensure that you pick up
the correct version of the driver. If you are unsure of the version, check the version of your application with this command:

```
ldd object-file
```

1.  Move to the directory where you put the `basicsql.cpp` file.

2.  Set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
+
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-odbc-driver-dlls>
```

3.  In the `/etc/odbc/TRAFDSN` file, add the correct IP address to the `Server` parameter for the `Default_DataSource`. For example:
+
*Example*
+
```
[Default_DataSource]
Description = Default Data Source
Catalog = TRAFODION
Schema = SEABASE
DataLang = 0
FetchBufferSize = SYSTEM_DEFAULT
Server = TCP:1.2.3.4:23400 
SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = SYSTEM_DEFAULT
SQL_LOGIN_TIMEOUT = SYSTEM_DEFAULT
SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT = NO_TIMEOUT
```
+
<<<

4.  Compile the sample program.
+
```
g++ -g basicsql.cpp -L. -I. -ltrafodbc64 -o basicsql
```

5.  Run the sample program:
+
```
basicsql Default_DataSource <username> <password>
```

If the sample program runs successfully, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Using Connect String: DSN=Default_DataSource;UID=user1;PWD=pwd1;
Successfully connected using SQLDriverConnect.
Drop sample table if it exists... Creating sample table TASKS...
Table TASKS created using SQLExecDirect.
Inserting data using SQLBindParameter, SQLPrepare, SQLExecute Data
Data inserted.
Fetching data using SQLExecDirect, SQLFetch, SQLGetData

```
