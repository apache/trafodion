= Install TrafCI
These installation instructions apply to Trafodion Release 1.3.*_n_* and subsequent updates of the product until otherwise indicated.

== Installation Package

The distribution file for the Trafodion Command Interface (TrafCI) is packaged within the Trafodion clients tar file,
`clients-1.3.*_n_*.tar.gz`, on the Trafodion downloads site http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/download.html.
Use this distribution file to install TrafCI:

[cols="35%l,35%,30%",options="header"]
|===
| Distribution File | Description | Client Operating System
| trafci.zip        | Zip file    | Windows or Linux
|===

The distribution zip file contains this installer file: `trafciInstaller.jar`, an executable JAR file.

== Installation Requirements

The Trafodion Command Interface (TrafCI) runs on Windows and Linux. Before installing TrafCI on the client workstation, follow these
instructions:

* <<trafci_JRE, Install Java Runtime Environment>>
* <<trafci_install_jdbct4, Install JDBC Type-4 Driver>>
* <<trafci_perl_python, Install Perl or Python>>

[[trafci_JRE]]
=== Install/Verify Java Runtime Environment

TrafCI and the Trafodion JDBC Type 4 Driver require that a compatible Java version be installed on the client workstation and that the Java
path be set to the correct location. The supported Java version is 1.7 or higher.

To determine the Java version that you have installed on your client workstation and to install a supported version, see
<<jdbct4_JRE, Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)>>.

[[trafci_install_jdbct4]]
=== Install/Verify JDBC Type-4 Driver
TrafCI requires a compatible version of the Trafodion JDBC Type 4 Driver to be installed on the client workstation before you install TrafCI.

==== Install JDBC Type-4 Driver
To install and use the JDBC driver, see <<jdbct4_JRE, Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE)>>.

==== Verify JDBC Type-4 Driver
To display the version of the JDBC driver that is already installed on the client workstation:

1.  Change the directory to the lib directory, which contains the JDBC driver JAR file:
* On Windows, enter this command:
+
```
cd jdbc-installation-directory\lib
```
+
`_jdbc-installation-directory_` is the directory where you installed the JDBC driver.

* On Linux, enter this command:
+
```
cd jdbc-installation-directory/lib
```
+
`_jdbc-installation-directory_` is the directory where you installed the JDBC driver.

2.  Enter this command to return version information:
+
```
java -jar jdbcT4.jar
```
+
```
C:\> cd "\<user-specified directory>\lib"
C:\<user-specified directory>\lib> java -jar jdbcT4.jar
Traf_JDBC_Type4_Build_40894

C:\<user-specified directory>\lib>
```

If the JAR file is inaccessible or the returned version is not supported, see <<trafci_install_jdbct4, Install/Verify JDBC Type-4 Driver>>.

<<<
[[trafci_perl_python]]
=== Install Perl or Python

If you plan to use Perl or Python scripts with TrafCI, verify that you have Perl or Python installed on the client workstation. TrafCI supports
these versions of Perl and Python:

* Perl version 5.8.8
* Python version 2.3.4

If you do not have Perl or Python, download it from any open source software provider. You can perform this installation procedure anytime
before or after installing TrafCI.

If you plan to run the sample scripts provided with TrafCI, verify that you have the Perl JavaServer and Jython (Java implementation of Python)
installed on your client workstation. Use the TrafCI Installation Wizard to automatically download and install both the Perl JavaServer and
Jython open source extensions. To download them manually, see the `README` in the samples directory.

== Installation Instructions

NOTE: Before following the installation procedures, you must install the Trafodion JDBC Type 4 Driver on the client workstation. For more
information, see <<trafci_install_jdbct4, Install JDBC Type-4 Driver>>.

Follow these instructions to download and install TrafCI on the client workstation.

* <<trafci_download_installer, Download Installer>>
* <<trafci_run_installer, Run Executable JAR Installer>>

To uninstall TrafCI, see <<trafci_uninstall, Uninstall_TrafCI>>.

[[trafci_download_installer]]
