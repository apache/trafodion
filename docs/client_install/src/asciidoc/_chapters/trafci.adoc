= Install trafci

[[trafci-installation-requirements]]
== Installation Requirements

The Trafodion Command Interface (trafci) runs on Windows and Linux. Before installing trafci on the client workstation, 
ensure that you've installed the JDBC Type-4 driver. See the <<jdbct4, Install JDBC Type-4 Driver>> chapter above.

[[trafci_perl_python]]
=== Install Perl or Python

If you plan to use Perl or Python scripts with trafci, verify that you have Perl or Python installed on the client workstation. trafci supports
these versions of Perl and Python:

* Perl version 5.8.8
* Python version 2.3.4

If you do not have Perl or Python, download it from any open-source software provider. You can perform this installation procedure anytime
before or after installing trafci.

If you plan to run the sample scripts provided with trafci, verify that you have the Perl JavaServer and Jython (Java implementation of Python)
installed on your client workstation. Use the trafci Installation Wizard to automatically download and install both the Perl JavaServer and
Jython open source extensions. To download them manually, see the `README` in the samples directory.

<<<
[[trafci-installation-instructions]]
== Installation Instructions

You download and extract the {project-name} client package using the instructions in <<introduction-download, Download Installation Package>> above.

1.  Change the directory to the `clients` subdirectory.

2.  Extract the contents of the `trafci.zip` file to a location on your client workstation (for example, a folder named `trafci`) by
using the unzip command (or the extract function of your compression software):
+
```
cd $HOME/trafodion-download/clients
unzip trafci.zip -d trafci
cd trafci
```
+
The command extracts these files:
+
* `README`
* `trafciInstaller.jar`

[[trafci-run-installer]]
=== Run Executable JAR Installer

When using the executable JAR file, `trafciInstaller.jar`, to install trafci, you have a choice of running the installer from the Installer
Wizard Graphical User Interface (GUI) or from the command line:

* <<trafci-wizard-install, Installer Wizard Steps>>
* <<trafci-cmd-install, Command-Line Installation Steps>>

[[trafci-wizard-install]]
==== Installer Wizard Steps

NOTE: On Linux, to run the Installer Wizard, you must have the X Window system installed on the client workstation. If the client workstation
does not have the X Window system, see <<trafci-cmd-install, Command-Line Installation Steps>>.

<<<
===== Launching the Installer Wizard

1.  Locate the `trafciInstaller.jar` file in the folder where you extracted the contents of the distribution (`.zip`) file.
2.  Verify that the `trafciInstaller.jar` file appears as an executable JAR File. If not, skip the next two steps and go to Step 5.
3.  Double-click the `trafciInstaller.jar` file to launch the Installer Wizard.
4.  Proceed to <<trafci-using-wizard, Using the Installer Wizard>>.
5.  At a command prompt, change to the directory where you extracted the installer files:
+
```
cd installer-directory
```
+
`_installer-directory_` is the directory where you extracted the installer file, `trafciInstaller.jar`.

6.  Launch the Installer Wizard by entering:
+
```
java -jar trafciInstaller.jar
```
