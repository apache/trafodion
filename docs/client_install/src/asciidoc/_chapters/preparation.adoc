= Preparation

{project-name} provides JDBC and ODBC drivers plus clients that use those drivers.
In addition, you can configure third-party JDBC- and ODBC-based tools to work
with {project-name}.

Typically, you install and configure the client software in the following order:

. JDBC and/or ODBC drivers. (Depending on what clients you plan to use.)
. {project-name} clients. For example, trafci and odb.
. Third-party clients. For example, DBVisualizer, SQuirell, and/or Tableau.

If you don't plan to use JDBC-based clients, then please skip ahead to
<<download-client-software, Download Client Software>>.

[[java-setup]]
== Java Setup

The {project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver requires Java 1.7 or higher. You need to set
the Java path to the correct location.

Depending on your planned usage, you install
the Java Development Kit (JDK, if you plan to develop Java-based applications)
or the Java Runtime Environment (JRE, if you plan to use packaged JDBC-based
products only).

[[java-validation]]
=== Verify Java Version

To display the Java version of the client workstation on the screen, enter:

```
java -version
```

.Example 1: Java Installed and PATH Variable Set Correctly

```
C:\> java -version

java version "1.7.0_45" # This is the version you need to check
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode, sharing)
C:\>
```

If the version is not 1.7 or higher, then please upgrade you Java installation
See <<java-install, Install Java>>.

If the version is 1.7 or higher, then skip ahead to <<download-client-software, Download Client Software>>.

.Example 2: Path Not Set

```
'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`
```

If you have installed Java, then this message indicates that you've not included
the Java directory in your search path. See <<howto-setup-path, Set Up PATH Variable>>.

[[java-install]]
=== Install Java

Refer to: http://www.java.com/en/download.

Once installed, follow the instruction in <<howto-setup-path, Set Up PATH Variable>>
to ensure that your Java environment has been set up properly.

[[download-client-software]]
== Download Client Software

The {project-name} client software is available from the {download-url}[{project-name} Download] page. There is one
`{project-name} Clients` package per release listed under *<version> Binaries*.

The `{project-name} Clients` package consists of a zipped tar file that contains the {project-name} Clients tar file.
The {project-name} Client binaries are in the `clients` folder, which contains the following files:

{project-support} for help obtaining the driver.

<<<
[[download-windows]]
=== Windows Download

Do the following:

. Create a download folder on the client workstation. For example, `c:\trafodion`.

. Open a Web browser and navigate to the {project-name} downloads site {download-url}.

.  Orient yourself to the binaries for the release you're installing.
Click on the `{project-name} Clients` link to start downloading the {project-name} clients tar file to your workstation.

.  Place the `apache-trafodion-clients-*.tar.gz` file into the download folder.
*  Unpack the `apache-trafodion-clients-\*.tar.gz` file using an unzip program of your choice. This creates
an `apache-trafodion-clients-*.tar` file.
* Unpack the `apache-trafodion-clients-*.tar` file using an unzip program of your choice.

. Verify content of the `clients` directory:
+
```
JDBCT4.zip LICENSE NOTICE odb64_linux.tar.gz trafci.zip TRAF_ODBC_Linux_Driver_64.tar.gz
```
+
You use these files to install the different {project-name} clients.

<<<
[[download-linux]]
=== Linux Download

Do the following:

. Create a download directory on the client workstation. For example, `$HOME/trafodion`.

. Open a Web browser and navigate to the {project-name} downloads site {download-url}.

.  Orient yourself to the binaries for the release you're installing.
Right-click on the `{project-name} Clients` link and select *Copy link address*.

.  Go to the download directory on the client workstation and use `wget` to download the client package
using the URL you copied in step 3 above.

.  Unpack the `apache-trafodion-clients-*.tar.gz` using `tar`.
+
*Example*
+
```

[[unpack-client-software]]
== Unpack Client Software

The client packages are located on the `client` subdirectory where you unpacked
the {project-name} distribution file. For example, `c:\trafodion\clients` (Windows)
or `$HOME/trafodion/clients` (Linux).

Unpack the client software and its dependencies you intend to use as follows.

=== Unpack JDBC-Based Client Software

[cols="30%,30%,40%a", options="header"]
|===
| File | Description | Recommended Target Directory 
| `JDBCT4.zip` | JDBC Type 4 Driver | * *Windows:* `c:\trafodion\jdbct4`
+
* *Linux:* `$HOME/trafodion/jdbct4`
| `trafci.zip` | Command Interface | * *Windows:* `c:\trafodion\trafci`
+
* *Linux:* `$HOME/trafodion/trafci`
|===

*Windows*

Use your favorite compress/uncompress utility to unpack the file to the target directory
defined in the table above.

*Linux*

Unpack the `.zip` file using the `unzip <file> -d <target-directory>` command:

```
$ cd $HOME/trafodion/clients
$ unzip JDBCT4.zip -d $HOME/trafodion/jdbct4
.
.
.
$ unzip trafci.zip -d $HOME/trafodion/trafci
.
.
.
$ cd ..
$ ls
apache-trafodion_clients-2.2.0.tar.gz  clients  jdbct4  trafci
$
```

Once complete, a fully-installed `c:\trafodion` (Windows) or
`$HOME/trafodion` directory should contain the following directories:

* `clients`: The compressed client software.
* `jdbct4`: The {project-name} JDBC Type 4 driver installation directory.
* `trafci`: The {project-name} Command Interpreter installation directory.

=== Unpack ODBC-Based Client Software

|===

*Linux*

Unpack the `.tar.gz` file using the `tar -xzvf <file> -C <target-directory>` command.

```
$ cd $HOME/trafodion/clients
$ mkdir $HOME/trafodion/odbc
$ tar -xzvf TRAF_ODBC_Linux_Driver_64.tar.gz -C $HOME/trafodion/odbc
