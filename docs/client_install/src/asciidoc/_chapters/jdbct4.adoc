[[jdbct4]]
= Install JDBC Type-4 Driver

[[jdbct4-installation-requirements]]
== Installation Requirements

The {project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver requires a Java-enabled platform that supports the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7 or higher.

[[jdbct4-java-environment]]
=== Java Environment

The {project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver requires that a compatible Java version be installed on the client workstation and that the Java path be set to
the correct location. The supported Java version is 1.7 or higher.

NOTE: If you plan to do Java-based development, install the Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
These examples use JRE.

[[jdbct4-verify-java-version]]
==== Verify Java Version

To display the Java version of the client workstation on the screen, enter:

```
java -version
```

```
C:\> java -version

java version "1.7.0_45" # This is the version you need to check
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode, sharing)
C:\>
```

The Java version should be *1.7* or higher. If the returned version is not supported, please refer to
<<jdbct4-install-java, Installing a Supported Java Version>> below.

<<<
If you see this message:

```
'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`
```

It indicates that the Java PATH is not set. Follow one of these sets of instructions, depending on the operating system of your client
workstation:

* <<jdbct4-path-windows, Setting the PATH to a Supported Java Version on Windows>>
* <<jdbct4-path-linux, Setting the PATH to a Supported Java Version on Linux>>

[[jdbct4-install-java]]
==== Install Supported Java Version

The supported Java version is 1.7 or higher. To install one of the supported Java versions on the client workstation,
go to this link: http://www.java.com/en/download

After installing the Java version, proceed with setting the Java path. Follow one of these sets of instructions, depending on the operating
system of your client workstation:

* <<jdbct4-path-windows, Setting the PATH to a Supported Java Version on Windows>>
* <<jdbct4-path-linux, Setting the PATH to a Supported Java Version on Linux>>

[[jdbct4-path-windows]]
==== Set Windows PATH Variable

===== Windows 10

1. Right-click on the Windows icon on the menu bar. Select *System*.

2. Click on *Advanced System Settings*.

3.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click the *Advanced* tab.
4.  Click the *Environment Variables* button.
5.  Under *System* variables, select the variable named *Path*, and then click *Edit. . .*:
+
image:{images}/win10_edit_path.jpg[Windows 10 Edit Path Variable]

6.  Click *Browse. . .*. Find the directory where you installed Java and select it.
+
image:{images}/win10_select_java.jpg[image]

7.  Click *OK* to close the browse window. Click *OK* to close the edit window.
8.  Verify that the updated *Path* appears under *System* variables, and click *OK*.
9.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click *OK* to accept the changes.


===== Windows 8

1.  Open system Right-click the *Computer* icon on your desktop, and then select *Properties*. The *Control Panel > System and Security > System* window
appears.

2. In the left navigation bar, click the *Advanced* system settings link.

3.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click the *Environment Variables* button.

4.  Under *System* variables, select the variable named *Path*, and then click *Edit*:
+
image:{images}/path2.jpg[image]

5.  Place the cursor at the start of the *Variable* value field and enter the path of the Java bin directory, ending with a semicolon (;):
+
image:{images}/varval2.jpg[image]
+
*Example*
+
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin";
```
+
NOTE: Check that no space exists after the semicolon (;) in the path. If there are spaces in the directory name, delimit the entire directory
path in double quotes (") before the semicolon.

6.  Click *OK*.
7.  Verify that the updated *Path* appears under *System* variables, and click *OK*.
8.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click *OK* to accept the changes.

[[jdbct4-path_linux]]
==== Set Linux PATH Variable

1.  Open the user profile (`.profile` or `.bash_profile` for the Bash shell) in the `$HOME` directory.
+
```
cd $HOME
vi .profile
```

2.  In the user profile, set the `PATH` environment variable to include the path of the Java bin 
directory. 
+
```
export PATH=/opt/java1.7/jre/bin:$PATH
```
+
NOTE: Place the path of the Java bin directory before `$PATH`, and check that no space exists after the colon (:) in the path. In the C shell,
use the setenv command instead of export.

3.  To activate the changes, either log out and log in again or execute the user profile.
+
```
. .profile
```

[[jdbct4-install-instructions]]
== Installation Instructions

You download and extract the {project-name} client package using the instructions in <<introduction-download, Download Installation Package>> above.

[[jdbct4-install-driver]]
=== Install JDBC Type-4 Driver

1.  Change the directory to the `clients` subdirectory.
2.  Extract the contents of the `JDBCT4.zip` file by using the unzip command (or the extract function of your compression software):
+
*Example*
+
```
unzip JDBCT4.zip -d $HOME/jdbc
```

The content of the target directory is as follows:

[[jdbct4-setup-env]]
== Set Up Client Environment

=== Java Development

If you plan to write and run Java applications that use the {project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver to connect to a {project-name} database, then set these
environment variables on the client workstation, replacing `_jdk-directory_` with the location of your Java Development Kit and
replacing `_jdbc-installation-directory_` with the name of the directory where you downloaded the JDBC Type 4 driver:

[cols="20%l,40%l,40%l",options="header"]
|===
| Environment Variable | On Windows                                                              | On Linux
| JAVA_HOME            | set JAVA_HOME="_jdk-directory_"^1^                                      | export JAVA_HOME=_jdk-directory_
| PATH                 | set PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin                                         | export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
| CLASSPATH            | set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;_jdbc-installation-directory_\lib\jdbcT4.jar; | export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:_jdbc-installation-directory_/lib/jdbcT4.jar:
|===

^1^ Enclose the _jdk-directory_ in quotes to ensure that Windows can find the directory correctly. You can use the `set <variable>` command to verify the setting.

<<<
=== Configure Applications

Edit the `t4jdbc.properties` file in the `samples` folder. Refer to the `README` file in the `samples` folder for instructions.

Set these values for your environment:

* _catalog_: Specify a catalog that exists in the database.
* _schema_: Specify a schema that exists in the database.
* _user_: Specify the name of a user who will be accessing the database.
* _password_: Specify the password of a user who will be accessing the database.
* _url_: Specify this string: _jdbc:t4jdbc://_host-name_:_port-number_/:_

_host-name_ is the IP address or host name of the database platform, and _port-number_ is the location where the 
{project-name} Database Connectivity Service (DCS) is running, which is *23400* by default. See the
http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/docs/dcs_reference/index.html[{project-name} Database Connectivity Services Reference Guide]
for information about how to configure the DCS port.

*Example*

In this example, {project-name} authentication has not been enabled. Therefore, you can use a dummy
user and password. If authentication is enabled, then use your user and password information.

```
catalog = TRAFODION
schema = SEABASE
user = usr
password = pwd

url = jdbc:t4jdbc://trafodion.host.com:23400/:
```

NOTE: The driver’s class name is `org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4Driver`.

<<<
[[jdbct4-test-programs]]
== Test Programs

The `README` file in the `samples` folder provide information for how you build and run sample Java programs.
You can use these programs to verify the setup of the {project-name} JDBC Type-4 driver.
See the <<jdbct4-install-driver, Install JDBC Type-4 Driver>> section above for information on the different
sample programs that are included with the {project-name} JDBC Type-4 driver.

*Example*

Build and run the StatementSample test program to verify the JDBC Type-4 driver installation.
