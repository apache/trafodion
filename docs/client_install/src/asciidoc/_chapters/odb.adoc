[[installation-requirements]]
== Installation Requirements

The odb tool runs on 64-bit Linux. On a Linux workstation, odb requires `pthread` libraries, which are usually installed by default. It also
requires the unixODBC Driver Manager to be installed and configured on the client workstation. For more information, see the
{docs-url}/odb/index.html[_{project-name} odb User Guide_].

[[installation-instructions]]
== Installation Instructions

NOTE: Before following these installation instructions, please make sure to install and configure unixODBC on the client workstation. For more
information, see the {docs-url}/odb/index.html[_{project-name} odb User Guide_].

You download and extract the {project-name} client package using the instructions in <<introduction-download, Download Installation Package>> above.

[[odb-install]]
=== Install odb

1.  Change the directory to the `clients` subdirectory.
2.  Unpack the contents of the `odb64_linux.tar.gz` file to a location on your client workstation:
+
```
mkdir $HOME/odb
tar -xzf odb64_linux.tar.gz -C $HOME/odb
```
+
The command extracts these files:
+
* `README`
* `/bin/odb64luo` (the odb executable)
