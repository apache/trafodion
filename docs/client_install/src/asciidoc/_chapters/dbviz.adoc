= Configure DbVisualizer

== Prerequisite Software

Make sure that you have this software installed on your workstation:

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.7 or higher. See <<jdbct4-java-environment, Java Environment>> in the <<jdbct4, Install JDBC Type-4 Driver>> chapter above.
+
In addition, see DbVisualizer’s FAQ “How to” page:
http://confluence.dbvis.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3146120[_How do I change the Java version that DbVisualizer uses?_]
* Trafodion JDBC Type-4 Driver. See <<jdbct4,Install JDBC Type-4 Driver>> above.
* DbVisualizer 9.x.x. See the http://www.dbvis.com/[_DbVisualizer website_].

== Configuration Instructions

=== Disable Connection Validation Select Option

==== DbVisualizer 9.1 (or an earlier version)
Edit the `_DbVisualizer-Install-Dir_\resources\dbvis-custom.prefs` file and
disable the `ConnectionValidationSelect` option as shown below:

```
dbvis.generic.-ConnectionValidationSelect=disabled
```

==== DbVisualizer 9.2 (or a later version)
Set the *Physical Connection* property to keep your connections alive. Follow these steps:

1.  Double-click the database connection, select the *Properties* tab.
2.  In the left navigation tree, expand the *Generic* connection properties, and select *Physical Connection*.
3.  Under *Validation SQL*, enter `values(current_timestamp)` and click *Apply*.

=== Register JDBC Type-4 Driver

Use the DbVisualizer Driver Manager and register the Trafodion JDBC Type-4 Driver.

* Use the Open File icon and locate the Trafodion JDBC Type-4 Driver.
* Use the JDBC URL format:
+
```
jdbc:t4jdbc://<host-name or ip-address>:23400/:
```
+
*NOTE*: This example uses a modified port number (*37800*) rather than the default port number (*23400*).

<<<
=== Connect to Trafodion

Create a new connection by selecting the Trafodion JDBC Type-4 Driver and filling in the connection parameters. Edit the database URL to match
your Trafodion system’s host name and port number; for example: `jdbc:t4jdbc://<host-name or ip-address>:37800/:` (default is: *23400*).

Once you have connected successfully, execute a query using SQL Commander to confirm the connection.
