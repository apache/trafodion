= Install and Configure

== Install TrafCI
To install TrafCI on a client workstation, follow the procedures in the 
http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/docs/client_install/index.html[_Trafodion Client Installation Guide_].

[[install_verify]]
== Verify and Set the Java Path
=== Set PATH on Windows

1.  Right-click the *Computer* icon on your desktop, and then select *Properties*. 
The *Control Panel>System and Security>System* window appears.
2.  In the left navigation bar, click the *Advanced* system settings link.
3.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click the *Environment Variables* button.
4.  Under _System variables_, select the variable named *Path*, and then click *Edit*:
+
image:{images}/path2.jpg[image]

5.  Place the cursor at the beginning of the _Variable_ value field and enter the path of the Java
`bin` directory, ending with a semicolon (`;`):
+
image:{images}/varval2.jpg[image]
+
```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin";
```
+
NOTE: Check that no space exists after the semicolon (;) in the path. If there are spaces in the directory name, delimit the entire directory
path in double quotes (") before the semicolon.

6.  Click *OK*.
7.  Verify that the updated Path appears under _System variables_, and click OK.
8.  In the *System Properties* dialog box, click *OK* to accept the changes.

=== Set PATH on Linux
1.  Open the user profile (`.profile` or `.bash_profile` for the Bash shell) in the `$HOME` directory.
+
```
vi .profile
```

2.  In the user profile, set the `PATH` environment variable to include path of the Java bin
directory. 
+
```
export PATH=/opt/java1.7/jre/bin:$PATH
```
+
NOTE: Place the path of the Java bin directory before `$PATH`, and check that no space exists after the colon (`:`) in the path. 
In the C shell, use the `setenv` command instead of export.

3.  To activate the changes, either log out and log in again or execute the user profile.
+
```
. .profile
```

== Test TrafCI Launch
1.  Launch TrafCI and verify that you can connect to the database. For
instructions, see <<launch_trafci, Launch TrafCI>>.
+
This window should appear:
+
image:{images}/launch02.jpg[image]

2.  If you cannot launch TrafCI or connect to the database, verify that:
+
* The database platform is available and running, and the port number is correct for the database platform.
* The Java path is set to the correct location. See <<install_verify, Verify and Set the Java Path>>.
* You installed the TrafCI and JDBC software files correctly.
