= Run Scripts

[[script_create]]
== Create a Script File

A script file that you run in TrafCI must be an ASCII text file that contains only these elements:

* <<script_sql_statements, SQL Statements>>
* <<script_commands, Commands>>
* <<script_comments, Comments>>
* <<script_section_headers, Section Headers>>

For an example, see <script_example, Example Script File>>.

NOTE: You cannot use shell commands in a script file that you run in TrafCI. To create shell scripts
that run TrafCI, see <<perl_or_python, Run TrafCI from Perl or Python>>.

[[script_sql_statements]]
== SQL Statements

Script files support any of the various SQL statements that you can run in TrafCI. For more information about
SQL statements, see the
http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/sql_reference/index.html[_Trafodion SQL Reference Manual_].

[[script_commands]]
== Commands

Most interface commands are supported in script files except the FC command. For a list of the interface commands, see
<<commands, Commands>>.

[[script_comments]]
== Comments

You can include comments anywhere in a script file. SQL also supports comments. Comments are useful for documenting
the functionality of the script file and for debugging. When debugging, use comments to disable
specific statements or commands without removing them from the script file.

To denote a comment in a script file, use two hyphens before the comment:

```
-- comment
```

The end of the line marks the end of the comment.

[[script_section_headers]]
== Section Headers

To create sections of commands within a script file, put a section header at the beginning of each section:

====
?SECTION section-name
====

The `_section-name_` cannot begin with a number or an underscore. Each section name in a script file should be unique
because TrafCI executes the first section that it finds that matches the section name in the `@` or `OBEY` command.
For more information, see the <<cmd_at_sign, @ Command>> <<cmd_obey, OBEY Command>>.

[[script_example]]
== Example Script File

This script file creates tables in the inventory schema:

image:{images}/script.jpg[Sample script]

== Run a Script File

To run a script file in TrafCI, use the `@` or OBEY command. The `@` and `OBEY` commands run one script file at a time
in TrafCI. To run a script file when launching TrafCI, see <<trafci_run_script, Run Script When Launching TrafCI>>.

*Example*

This `@` command runs a script file, `sch_invent.sql`, that creates tables in the inventory schema:

====
@C:\ddl_scripts\sch_invent.sql
====

NOTE: If the script file is outside the directory of the `trafci.cmd` or `trafci.sh` file (by default, the `bin` directory),
you must specify the full path of the script file in the `@` or `OBEY` command.

```
SQL>@C:\ddl_scripts\sch_invent.sql
SQL>-- CREATE SCHEMA
SQL>CREATE SCHEMA INVENT;

--- SQL operation complete.

SQL>-- CREATE TABLES/VIEWS in SCHEMA INVENT
SQL> SET SCHEMA INVENT;

--- SQL operation complete.

SQL>CREATE TABLE INVENT.supplier (
+> suppnum NUMERIC (4) UNSIGNED
+> NO DEFAULT
+> NOT NULL
+> ,suppname CHARACTER (18)
+> NO DEFAULT
+> NOT NULL
+> ,street CHARACTER (22)
+> NO DEFAULT
+> NOT NULL
+> ,city CHARACTER (14)
+> NO DEFAULT
+> NOT NULL
+> ,state CHARACTER (12)
+> NO DEFAULT
+> NOT NULL
+> ,postcode CHARACTER (10)
+> NO DEFAULT
+> NOT NULL
+> ,PRIMARY KEY (suppnum)
+> );

--- SQL operation complete.
```

For more information about the `@` and `OBEY` commands, see the <<cmd_at_sign, @ Command>> and
the <<cmd_obey, OBEY Command>>.

== Log Output

To log output of an TrafCI session while running one script file at a time, use the `SPOOL` or `LOG` command.
When you run an `OBEY` or `@` command, TrafCI displays each command in the script file, the output for each
command, and diagnostic messages in TrafCI. The `SPOOL` or `LOG` command captures this output as it appears
in TrafCI and logs it in a log file.

For more information, <<interactive_log_output, Log Output>>.

== Run Scripts in Parallel

In TrafCI, the `@` and `OBEY` commands allow you to run only one script file at a time. However, the `PRUN` command
allows you to run multiple script files simultaneously.

The `PRUN` command is most useful for running sets of data definition language (DDL) statements simultaneously, which
speeds up the process of creating large databases. Put all dependent or related DDL statements in the same script file.
For more information on running scripts in parallel using the `PRUN` command, see the <<cmd_prun, PRUN Command>>.
