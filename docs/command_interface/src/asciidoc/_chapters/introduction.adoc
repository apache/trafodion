= Introduction
The Trafodion Command Interface (trafci) is a command-line interface that you download and install on a client workstation that has the
{project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver installed. Operating systems that support the JDBC driver include Windows and Linux. The JDBC driver connects
trafci on a client workstation to a {project-name} database.

trafci enables you to perform daily administrative and database management tasks by running SQL statements or other commands
interactively or from script files. You can also run trafci from a Perl or Python command line or from Perl or Python programs.
