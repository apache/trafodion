= Introduction
The Trafodion Command Interface (trafci) is a command-line interface that you download and install on a client workstation that has the
Trafodion JDBC Type 4 Driver installed. Operating systems that support the JDBC driver include Windows and Linux. The JDBC driver connects
trafci on a client workstation to a Trafodion database.

trafci enables you to perform daily administrative and database management tasks by running SQL statements or other commands
interactively or from script files. You can also run trafci from a Perl or Python command line or from Perl or Python programs.
