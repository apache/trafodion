<<<
[[cmd_at_sign]]
== @ Command
The `@` command executes the SQL statements and interface commands contained in a specified script file. The `@` command is
executed the same as the `OBEY` command. For more information on syntax and considerations, <<cmd_obey, OBEY Command>>.

=== Syntax

```
@{script-file | wild-card-pattern} [(section-name)]
```

* `_script-file_`
+
is the name of an ASCII text file that contains SQL statements, interface commands, and comments. If the script file exists outside the
local directory where you launch TrafCI (by default, the `bin` directory) specify the full directory path of the script file.

* `_wild-card-pattern_`
+
is a character string used to search for script files with names that match the character string. `_wild-card-pattern_` matches a string,
depending on the operating system for case-sensitivity, unless you enclose it within double quotes. To look for similar values, specify
only part of the characters of `_wild-card-pattern_` combined with these wild-card characters:
+
[cols="10%,90%"]
|===
| `*` | Use an asterisk (`*`) to indicate zero or more characters of any type. For example, `*art*` matches `SMART`, `ARTIFICIAL`, and `PARTICULAR`.
| `?` | Use a question mark (`?`) to indicate any single character. For example, `boo?` matches `BOOK` and `BOOT` but not `BOO` or `BOOTS`.
|===

* `(_section-name_)`
+
is the name of a section within the `_script-file_` to execute. If you specify `_section-name_`, the `@` command executes the commands between
the header line for the specified section and the header line for the next section (or the end of the script file).
If you omit `_section-name_`, the `@` command executes the entire script file. For more information, <<script_section_headers, Section Headers>>.

<<<
=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* Space is disallowed between the `@` sign and the first character of the script name.
* For additional considerations, see the <<cmd_obey, OBEY Command>>.

=== Examples

* This `@` command runs the script file from the local directory (the same directory where you are running TrafCI):
+
```
SQL> @ddl.sql
```

* This `@` command runs the script file in the specified directory on a Windows workstation:
+
```
 SQL> @c:\my_files\ddl.sql
```

* This `@` command runs the script file in the specified directory on a Linux or UNIX workstation:
+
```
SQL> @./my_files/ddl.sql
```

<<<
[[cmd_slash]]
== / Command

The `/` command executes the previously executed SQL statement. This command does not repeat an interface command.

=== Syntax

```
/
```

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line.
* The command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Example

This `/` command executes the previously executed `SELECT` statement:

```
SQL> SELECT COUNT() FROM persnl.employee;

(EXPR)
--------------------
62

--- 1 row(s) selected.

`SQL>`/

(EXPR)
--------------------
62

--- 1 row(s) selected.

SQL>
```

<<<
[[cmd_alias]]
== ALIAS Command
The `ALIAS` command allows you to map a string to any interface or SQL command. The syntax of the interface or SQL command
is checked only when the mapped string is executed. This command replaces only the first token of a command string, which allows
the rest of the tokens to be treated as parameters.

=== Syntax

```
ALIAS value AS command SQL-terminator
```

* `_value_`
+
is a case-insensitive string without spaces. `_Value_` cannot be a command.

* `_command_`
+
is an command or SQL command.

* `_SQL-terminator_`
+
is the default terminator (`;`) or a string value defined for the statement terminator by the
<<cmd_set_sqlterminator, SET SQLTERMINATOR Command>>. For more information, see
<<interactive_set_show_terminator, Set and Show the SQL Terminator>>.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* The `ALIAS` command lasts only for the duration of the session.
* An alias on an alias is not supported.

<<<
=== Examples

* This command creates an alias named `.OS` to perform the `LOCALHOST (LH)` command:
+
```
SQL> ALIAS .OS AS LH;
```

* This command executes the new `ALIAS` with the `ls` option:
+
```
SQL> .OS ls

trafci-perl.pl trafci-python.py trafci.cmd trafci.pl trafci.py trafci.sh
```

* This command creates an alias named `.GOTO` to perform the `GOTO` command:
+
```
SQL> ALIAS .GOTO AS GOTO; 
SQL> .GOTO mylabel
```
+
The `GOTO` statement executed, ignoring all commands until a `'LABEL MYLABEL'` command is encountered.

* This command creates an alias named USE to perform the `SET SCHEMA` operation, uses the alias to set the schema to
`TRAFODION.USR`, and checks the current schema to verify that the alias worked correctly:
+
```
SQL> ALIAS use AS "SET SCHEMA";
SQL> use TRAFODION.USR;
SQL> SHOW SCHEMA

SCHEMA USR
```

<<<
[[cmd_clear]]
== CLEAR Command

The `CLEAR` command clears the interface window so that only the prompt appears at the top of the window. `CLEAR` does not clear the log file or
reset the settings of the session.

=== Syntax

```
CLEAR
```

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line.
* The `CLEAR` command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Example

This CLEAR command clears the interface window:

```
SQL> CLEAR
```

After the CLEAR command executes, the interface window appears with only the prompt showing:

```
SQL>
```

<<<
[[cmd_connect]]
== CONNECT Command

The `CONNECT` command creates a new connection to the database from the current or existing TrafCI session.

=== Syntax

```
CONNECT [ username [ /password ][@hostname]]
```

* `_username_`
+
specifies the user name for logging in to the database platform.
+
** If the user name is not specified, then TrafCI prompts for the user name.
** If the user name contains spaces or special characters, such as a period (`.`), hyphen (`-`), or underscore (`_`),
then put the name within double quotes. For example: *"sq.user-1"*.

* `_/password_`
+
specifies the password of the user for logging in to the database platform.
+
** If the password is not specified, then TrafCI prompts for the password.
** If the password contains spaces or special characters, such as `@` or a single quote (`'`), then put the password
within double quotes. For example: *"Tr@f0d!0n"*.

* `_@hostname_`
+
specifies the host name or IP address of the database platform to which you want the client to connect.
+
** If the hostname is not specified, then the value is automatically used from the current TrafCI session.
** If TrafCI was invoked with the `-noconnect` launch parameter, then you are prompted for a `_hostname_` value.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* If TrafCI was invoked with the `-noconnect` launch parameter, then TrafCI prompts you for the values.
* If the user name or password contains space or special characters, then you must put the name or password within double quotes.

=== Examples

* This command creates a new connection to the {project-name} database from the current or existing TrafCI session:
+
```
SQL> CONNECT

User Name: user1
Password:

[[cmd_delay]]
== DELAY Command

The `DELAY` command allows the TrafCI session to be in sleep mode for the specified interval.

=== Syntax

```
DELAY time [sec[ond][s] | min[ute][s]]
```

* `_time_`
+
is an integer.

=== Considerations

* If `seconds` or `minutes` are not specified, then the default is `seconds`.
* The maximum delay limit is 3600 seconds. You can override this value by setting `trafci.maxDelayLimit` in `_JAVA_OPTIONS`.
The unit is seconds for `trafci.maxDelayLimit`.
* This command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Examples

* This DELAY command puts the TrafCI session to sleep for 5 seconds before executing the next command:
+
```
SQL> DELAY 5 secs
SQL> SHOW VIEWS
```

* This DELAY command puts TrafCI session to sleep for 5 minutes before executing the next command, which is to exit the session:
+
```
SQL> DELAY 5 mins 
SQL> EXIT
```

<<<
[[cmd_disconnect]]
== DISCONNECT Command

The `DISCONNECT` command terminates the connection from the database, not from TrafCI.

=== Syntax

```
DISCONNECT [WITH] [status] [IF {condition}]
```

* _status_
+
is any 1-byte integer. `_status_` is a shell return value, and the range of allowable values is platform dependent.

* _condition_
+
is the same as the condition parameter defined for the <<cmd_if_then, IF&8230;THEN Command>>. See <<cmd_conditional_parameters, Condition Parameter>>.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* After you disconnect from the {project-name} database, you can still run these interface commands:

[[cmd_env]]
== ENV Command

`ENV` displays attributes of the current TrafCI session. You can also use the `SESSION` and `SHOW SESSION` commands to perform the same function.

=== Syntax

```
ENV
```

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* ENV displays these attributes:

[cols="15%,85%",options="header"]
|===
| Attribute       | Description
| `COLSEP`        | Current column separator, which is used to control how query results are displayed. For more information, see <<cmd_set_colsep, SET COLSEP Command>>.
| `HISTOPT`       | Current history options, which controls how the commands are added to the history buffer. For more information, see <<cmd_set_histopt, SET HISTOPT Command>>.

[[cmd_exit]]
== EXIT Command

The `EXIT` command disconnects from and exits TrafCI. `EXIT` can return a status code.
If no status code is specified, then `0` (zero) is returned by default. In addition, a conditional statement
can be appended to the command.


=== Syntax

```
EXIT [WITH] [status] [IF {condition}]
```

* `_status_`
+
is any 1-byte integer. `_status_` is a shell return value, and the range of allowable values is platform dependent.

* `_condition_`
+
is the same as the condition parameter defined for the <<cmd_if_then, IF&8230;THEN Command>>.
See <<cmd_conditional_parameter, Condition Parameter>>.

=== Considerations

You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Examples

* This command disconnects from and exits TrafCI, which disappears from the screen:
+
```
SQL> EXIT
```

<<<
* In a script file, the conditional exit command causes the script file to quit running and disconnect from
and exit TrafCI when the previously run command returns error code `4082`:
+
```
LOG c:\errorCode.log 
SELECT * FROM employee;
EXIT IF errorcode=4082
LOG OFF
```
+
These results are logged when error code 4082 occurs:
+
```
SQL> SELECT * FROM employee;

**** ERROR[4082] Table, view or stored procedure TRAFODION.USR.EMPLOYEE does not exist or is inaccessible.

SQL> EXIT IF errorcode=4082
```

* The following two examples are equivalent:
+
```
SQL> EXIT -1 IF LASTERROR <> 0
SQL> EXIT WITH -1 IF LASTERROR != 0
```

* This example exits TrafCI if the last error code is equal to `4082`:
+
```
SQL> EXIT WITH 82 IF LASTERROR == 4082 
SQL> EXIT -- default status is 0
```

<<<
[[cmd_fc]]
== FC Command

The `FC` command allows you to edit and reissue a command in the history buffer of an TrafCI session.
You can display the commands in the history buffer by using the `HISTORY` command. For information about the history
buffer, see the <<cmd_history,HISTORY Command>>.

=== Syntax

```
FC [text | [-]number]
```

* `_text_`
+
is the beginning text of a command in the history buffer. Case is not significant in matching the text to a command.

* `[-]_number_`
+
is either a positive integer that is the ordinal number of a command in the history buffer or a negative integer that indicates the position of
a command relative to the most recent command.

Without text or number, `FC` retrieves the most recent command.

<<<
=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* You cannot execute this command in a script file. You can execute this command only at a command prompt.
* As each line of the command is displayed, you can modify the line by entering these editing commands (in uppercase or lowercase letters) on
the line below the displayed command line:

[cols="20%,80%",options="header"]
|===
| Edit Command      | Description
| `D`               | Deletes the character immediately above the letter `D`. Repeat to delete more characters.
| `I`_characters_   | Inserts characters in front of the character immediately above the letter `I`.
| `R`_characters_   | Replaces existing characters one-for-one with characters, beginning with the character immediately above the letter `R`.
| _characters_    | Replaces existing characters one-for-one with characters, beginning with the first character immediately above characters.
_`characters`_ must begin with a non-blank character.
|===

To specify more than one editing command on a line, separate the editing commands with a double slash (`//`). The end of a line terminates an
editing command or a set of editing commands.

After you edit a line of the command, TrafCI displays the line again and allows you to edit it again. Press *Enter* without specifying editing
commands to stop editing the line. If that line is the last line of the command, pressing *Enter* executes the command.

To terminate a command without saving changes to the command, use the double slash (`//`), and then press *Enter*.

=== Examples

* Re-execute the most recent command that begins with SH:
+
```
SQL> FC SH
SQL> SHOW SCHEMA 
....

```
+
Pressing *Enter* executes the `SHOW SCHEMA` command and displays the current schema, `PERSNL`:
+
```
SQL> FC SH
SQL> SHOW SCHEMA
....

SCHEMA PERSNL

SQL>
```

* Correct an SQL statement that you entered incorrectly by using the delete (`D`) editing command:
+
```
SQL> SELECT * FROM persnl.employee;

[[cmd_goto]]
== GOTO Command

The GOTO command allows you to jump to a designated point in the command history. The point in the command history is designated
by a `LABEL` command. All commands executed after a `GOTO` statement are ignored until the specified label is set. To set a label,
use the <<cmd_label, LABEL Command>>.

=== Syntax

```
GOTO {label}
```

* `_label_`
+
is a string of characters without quotes and spaces, or a quoted string.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line.
* The `GOTO` command cannot currently jump back in the command history; it is a forward-only command.

=== Examples

These examples show the use of the `GOTO` and `LABEL` commands:

```
SQL> GOTO ViewManagers
SQL> SELECT  FROM Employees; -- skipped
SQL> SHOW RECCOUNT;          -- skipped
SQL> LABEL ViewManagers
SQL> SELECT  FROM Managers;
SQL> GOTO "View Customers"
SQL> SELECT  FROM Invoices;  -- skipped
SQL> LABEL "View Customers"
SQL> SELECT  FROM Customers;
```

<<<
[[cmd_help]]
== HELP Command
The HELP command displays help text for the commands. See <<commands, Commands>> for a descriptions of the commands.

== Syntax

```
HELP [command-name]
```

`_command-name_`

is the name of a command.

* If you do not specify a command, then TrafCI returns a list of all commands.
* If you specify `SET`, then TrafCI returns a list of all SET commands.
* If you specify `SHOW`, then TrafCI returns a list of all `SHOW` commands.

=== Considerations

You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.

<<<
=== Examples

* This `HELP` command lists all the interface commands that are supported:
+
```
SQL> HELP
```

* This `HELP` command lists all the `SET` commands that are supported:
+
```
SQL> HELP SET
```

* This `HELP` command lists all the `SHOW` commands that are supported:
+
```
SQL> HELP SHOW
```

* This `HELP` command shows help text for `SET IDLETIMEOUT`:
+
```
SQL> HELP SET IDLETIMEOUT
```

<<<
[[cmd_history]]
== HISTORY Command

The `HISTORY` command displays recently executed commands, identifying each command by a number that you can use
to re-execute or edit the command.

=== Syntax

```
HISTORY [number]
```

* `_number_`
+
is the number of commands to display. The default number is `10`. The maximum number is `100`.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* You can use the `FC` command to edit and re-execute a command in the history buffer, or use the
`REPEAT` command to re-execute a command without modifying it. See <<cmd_fc,FC Command>> or
<<cmd_repeat,REPEAT Command>>.

=== Example

Display the three most recent commands and use `FC` to redisplay one:

```
SQL> HISTORY 3

14> SET SCHEMA SALES;
15> SHOW TABLES
16> SHOW VIEWS

SQL> FC 14

SQL> SET SCHEMA sales
....

```

Now you can use the edit capabilities of `FC` to modify and execute a different `SET SCHEMA` statement.

<<<
[[cmd_if_then]]
== IF&#8230;THEN Command

`IF&#8230;THEN` statements allow for the conditional execution of actions. If the condition is met, the action
is executed; otherwise, no action is taken.

=== Syntax

```
IF {condition} THEN {action} {SQL-terminator}
```

[[cmd_condition_parameter]]
* `_condition_`
+
The condition parameter (`_condition_`) is a Boolean statement structured as follows:
+

|===

* `_action_`
+
The action parameter (`_action_`) is any interface or SQL command.

* `_SQL Terminator_`
+
The SQL terminator (`_SQL-terminator_`) is the default terminator (`;`) or a string value defined for the statement
terminator by the <<cmd_set_sqlterminator, SET SQLTERMINATOR Command>>.
See <<interactive_set_show_terminator, Set and Show the SQL Terminator>>.

=== Considerations

* `IF&#8230;THEN` is itself an action. Thus, nested `IF&#8230;THEN` statements are allowed.
* An action must end with the SQL terminator, even if the action is an interface command.

<<<
=== Examples

These commands show multiple examples of `IF&#8230;THEN` statements:

<<<
[[cmd_label]]
== LABEL Command

The LABEL command marks a point in the command history that you can jump to by using the `GOTO` command.
For more information, see the <<cmd_goto, GOTO Command>>.

=== Syntax

```
LABEL {label}
```

* `_label_`
+
is a string of characters without quotes and spaces, or a quoted string.

=== Considerations

You must enter the command on one line.

=== Examples

* This command creates a label using a string of characters:
+
```
SQL> LABEL MyNewLabel
```

* This command creates a label using a quoted string:
+
```
SQL> LABEL "Trafodion Label"
```

<<<
[[cmd_localhost]]
== LOCALHOST Command

The `LOCALHOST` command allows you to execute client machine commands.

=== Syntax

```
LOCALHOST | LH <client M/C commands>
```

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* The `LOCALHOST` command has a limitation. When input is entered for the operating system commands
(for example, `date`, `time`, and `cmd`), the input is not visible until you hit the `enter` key.
* If the `SET TIMING` is set to `ON`, the elapsed time information is displayed.

=== Examples

* If you are using a Windows system, dir lists the contents of the directory name. Similarly, if you are on a UNIX system you enter
`LOCALHOST LS` to display the contents of the folder.

[[cmd_log]]
== LOG Command

The `LOG` command logs the entered commands and their output from TrafCI to a log file.
If this is an obey script file, then the command text from the obey script file is shown on the console.

=== Syntax

```
LOG { ON [CLEAR, QUIET, CMDTEXT {ON | OFF}]
    | log-file [CLEAR, QUIET, CMDTEXT {ON | OFF}]
    | OFF
    }
```

* `ON`
+
starts the logging process and records information in the `sqlspool.lst` file in the `bin` directory.

* `CLEAR`
+
instructs TrafCI to clear the contents of the sqlspool.lst file before logging new information to the file.

* `QUIET`
+
specifies that the command text is displayed on the screen, but the results of the command are written only to the log file and not to the screen.

* `CMDTEXT ON`
+
specifies that the command text and the log header are displayed in the log file.

* `CMDTEXT OFF`
+
specifies that the command text and the log header are not displayed in the log file.

* `_log-file_`
+
is the name of a log file into which TrafCI records the entered commands and their output. If you want the log file to exist outside the local
directory where you launch TrafCI (by default, the `bin` directory), specify the full directory path of the log file. The log file does not
need to exist, but the specified directory must exist before you execute the `LOG` command.

<<<
* `_log-file_ CLEAR`
+
instructs TrafCI to clear the contents of the specified `_log-file_` before logging new information to the file.

* `OFF`
+
stops the logging process.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* Use a unique name for each log file to avoid writing information from different TrafCI sessions into the same log file.

<<<
=== Examples


* This command starts the logging process and records information to the `sqlspool.lst` file in the `bin` directory:
+
```
SQL> LOG ON
```

* This command starts the logging process and appends new information to an existing log file, `persnl_updates.log`,
in the local directory (the same directory where you are running TrafCI):
+
```
SQL> LOG persnl_updates.log
```

* This command starts the logging process and appends new information to a log file,
`sales_updates.log`, in the specified directory on a Windows workstation:
+
```
SQL> LOG c:\log_files\sales_updates.log
```

* This command starts the logging process and appends new information to a log file,
`sales_updates.log`, in the specified directory on a Linux or UNIX workstation:

[[cmd_obey]]
== OBEY Command
The `OBEY` command executes the SQL statements and interface commands of a specified script file or an
entire directory. This command accepts a single filename or a filename with a wild-card pattern specified.
Executing the `OBEY` command without optional parameters prompts you to enter a filename. If a filename is
not specified, then `*.sql` is used.

=== Syntax

```
OBEY {script-file | wild-card-pattern} [(section-name)]
```

* `_script-file_`
+
is the name of an ASCII text file that contains SQL statements, interface commands, and comments. If the script file
exists outside the local directory where you launch TrafCI (by default, the `bin` directory), specify the full directory
path of the script file.

* `_wild-card-pattern_`
+
is a character string used to search for script files with names that match the character string. `_wild-card-pattern_`
matches a string, depending on the operating system for case-sensitivity, unless you enclose it within double quotes.
To look for similar values, specify only part of the characters of `_wild-card-pattern_` combined with these
wild-card characters:

* `(_section-name_)`
+
is the name of a section within the `_script-file_` to execute. If you specify `_section-name_`, the `OBEY` command
executes the commands between the header line for the specified section and the header line for the next section
(or the end of the script file). If you omit `_section-name_`, the `OBEY` command executes the entire script file.
For more information, see <<script_section_headers, Section Headers>>.

<<<
=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* Put a space between `OBEY` and the first character of the file name.
* You can execute this command in a script file.
* Before putting dependent SQL statements across multiple files, consider the order of the file execution. If a directory
is not passed to the `OBEY` command, the file or wild card is assumed to be in the current working directory.
* If the (`*`) is issued in the `OBEY` command, all files are executed in the current directory. Some of the files in
the directory could be binary files. The `OBEY` command tries to read those binary files and junk or invalid characters are
displayed on the console. For example, this command causes invalid characters to be displayed on the console:
+
```
SQL> OBEY C:\trafci\bin\
```

* `OBEY` detects recursive obey files (for example, an SQL file that calls OBEY on itself) and prevents infinite loops using
a max depth environment variable. If no variable is passed to the JVM, the default depth is set to `10`. To change this depth
(for example to a value of `20`), pass a Java environment variable as follows:
+
```
-Dtrafci.obeydepth=20
```

<<<
=== Examples

* This `OBEY` command runs the script file from the local directory (the same directory where you are running TrafCI):
+
```
SQL> OBEY ddl.sql
```

* This `OBEY` command runs the script file in the specified directory on Windows.
+
```
SQL> OBEY c:\my_files\ddl.sql
```

<<<
* This `OBEY` command runs the script file in the specified directory on a Linux or UNIX workstation:
+
```
SQL> OBEY ./my_files/ddl.sql
```

* This sample file contains sections to be used in conjunction with the `OBEY` command:
+
```

== PRUN Command

The `PRUN` command runs script files in parallel.

=== Syntax

```
PRUN { -d | -defaults }

PRUN
[ { -sd | -scriptsdir } scriptsdirectory ]
[ { -e  | -extension } filedirectory ]
[ { -ld | -logsdir } log-directory ]
[ { -o  | -overwrite } {Y | N}
[ { -c  | -connections } num ]
```

* `-d | -defaults`
+
Specify this option to have PRUN use these default settings:
+
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
| Parameter             | Default Setting
| `-sd \| -scriptsdir`  | `PRUN` searches for the script files in the same directory as the `trafci.sh` or `trafci.cmd` file (`_trafci-installation-directory_/trafci/bin` or 
`_trafci-installation-directory_\trafci\bin`).
| `-e \| -extension`    |  The file extension is `.sql`.
| `-ld \| -logsdir`     | `PRUN` places the log files in the same directory as the script files.
| `-o \| -overwrite`    | No overwriting occurs. `PRUN` keeps the original information in the log files and appends new information at the end of each file.
| `-c \| -connections`  | `PRUN` uses two connections.
|===

* `{-sd | -scriptsdir} _scripts-directory_`
+
In this directory, `PRUN` processes every file with the specified file extension. If you do not specify a directory or if you specify an
invalid directory, an error message occurs, and you are prompted to reenter the directory. Before running `PRUN`, verify that this directory
contains valid script files.

* `{-e | -extension} _file-extension_`
+
Specify the file extension of the script files. The default is `.sql`.

<<<
* `{-ld | -logsdir} _log-directory_`
+
In this directory, `PRUN` creates a log file for each script file by appending the `.log` extension to the name of the script file. If you do
not specify a log file directory, `PRUN` places the log files in the same directory as the script files.

* `{-o | -overwrite} {y | n}`
+
If you specify `y`, `PRUN` overwrites the contents of existing log files. By default, `PRUN` keeps the original information in the log files and
appends new information at the end of each file.

* `{-c | -connections} _num_`
+
Enter a number for the maximum number of connections If you do not specify the maximum number of connections, `PRUN` uses two connections.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* If you execute the `PRUN` command without any arguments, then TrafCI prompts you for the `PRUN` arguments. If you specify one or more options, 
then the `PRUN` command runs without prompting you for more input. In the non-interactive mode, if any options are not specified, `PRUN` uses the default values.
* The `-d` or `-defaults` option cannot be specified with any other option.
* The `PRUN` log files also contain the log end time.
* `PRUN` does not support the `SPOOL` or `LOG` commands. Those commands are ignored in `PRUN` script files.
* The environment values from the main session (which are available through the `SET` commands) are propagated to new sessions started via
`PRUN`. However, prepared statements and parameters are bound only to the main user session.
* For a summary of all errors and warnings that occurred during the `PRUN` operation, go to the error subdirectory in the same directory as the log
files (for example, `C:\log\error`) and open the `prun.err.log` summary file.
* For details about the errors that occurred during the execution of a script file, open each individual log file (`_script-file_.sql.log`).


<<<
=== Examples

* To use `PRUN`, enter the `PRUN` command in the TrafCI session:
+
```
SQL> PRUN
```
+
```
Enter  as input to stop the current prun session
--------------------------------------------------
Enter the scripts directory              : c:\ddl_scripts 
Enter the script file extension[sql]     :
Enter the logs directory[scripts dir]    : c:\log 
Overwrite the log files (y/n)[n]?        : y 
Enter the number of connections(2-248)[2]: 3
```
+
After you enter the number of connections, `PRUN` starts to process the script files and displays this status:
+
```
Status: In Progress.......
```
+
<<<
+
After executing all the script files, `PRUN` returns a summary of the operation:

[[cmd_quit]]
== QUIT Command

The `QUIT` command disconnects from and exits TrafCI.

=== Syntax

```
QUIT [WITH] [status] [IF {condition}]
```

* `_status_`
+
is any 1-byte integer. `_status_` is a shell return value, and the range of allowable values is platform dependent.

* `_condition_`
+
is the same as the condition parameter defined for the <<cmd_if_then, IF&#8230;THEN Command>>.
See <<cmd_conditional_parameters, Condition Parameters>>.

=== Considerations

You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Examples

* This command disconnects from and exits TrafCI, which disappears from the screen:
+
```
SQL> QUIT
```

* In a script file, the conditional exit command causes the script file to quit running and disconnect from and
exit TrafCI when the previously run command returns error code `4082`:
+
```
SQL> LOG c:\errorCode.log
SQL> SELECT * FROM employee;
SQL> QUIT IF errorcode=4082
SQL> LOG OFF
```
+
<<<
These results are logged when error code `4082` occurs:
+
```
SQL> SELECT * FROM employee;

**** ERROR[4082] Table, view or stored procedure TRAFODION.USR.EMPLOYEE does not exist or is inaccessible.

SQL> QUIT IF errorcode=4082
```

<<<
[[cmd_reconnect]]
== RECONNECT Command

The `RECONNECT` command creates a new connection to the {project-name} database using the login credentials of the last successful connection.

=== Syntax

```
RECONNECT
```

=== Considerations

The host name (or IP address) and port number, plus the credentials (user name and password), are used from information previously entered.
This is the information specified at launch or when the last `CONNECT` command was executed.

If TrafCI was invoked with the `-noconnect` launch parameter, TrafCI prompts you for the values.

=== Examples

* This command creates a new connection to the {project-name} database using the login credentials of the last successful connection:
+
```
SQL> RECONNECT

Connected to Trafodion
```

<<<
[[cmd_repeat]]
== REPEAT Command

The `REPEAT` command re-executes a previous command.

=== Syntax

```
REPEAT [text | [-]number ]
```

* `_text_`
+
specifies the text of the most recently executed command. The command must have been executed beginning with `_text_`,
but `_text_` need be only as many characters as necessary to identify the command. TrafCI ignores leading blanks.

* `[-]_number_`
+
is an integer that identifies a command in the history buffer. If number is negative, it indicates the position of the
command in the history buffer relative to the current command; if number is positive, it is the ordinal number of a
command in the history buffer.

The HISTORY command displays the commands or statements in the history buffer. See the <<cmd_history,HISTORY Command>>.

== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* To re-execute the immediately preceding command, enter `REPEAT` without specifying a number. If you enter more than one
command on a line, then the `REPEAT` command re-executes only the last command on the line.
* When a command is selected for repeat, and the SQL terminator value has changed since the execution of that command,
then TrafCI replaces the SQL terminator in the command with the current SQL terminator value and executes the command.

<<<
=== Examples

* Display the previously executed commands and re-execute the second to the last command:
+
```
SQL> HISTORY

[[cmd_reset_lasterror]]
== RESET LASTERROR Command

The `RESET LASTERROR` command resets the last error code to 0.

=== Syntax

```
RESET LASTERROR
```

=== Considerations

You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Examples

* This command resets the last error in the current session:
+
```
SQL> SELECT * FROM emp;

**** ERROR[4082]Object TRAFODION.SCH.EMP does not exist or is inaccessible.

SQL> SHOW LASTERROR

LASTERROR 4082

SQL> RESET LASTERROR
SQL> SHOW LASTERROR

LASTERROR 0
```

<<<
[[cmd_reset_param]]
== RESET PARAM Command

The RESET PARAM command clears all parameter values or a specified parameter value in the current session.

=== Syntax

```
RESET PARAM [param-name]
```

* `_param-name_`
+
is the name of the parameter for which you specified a value. Parameter names are case-sensitive. For example,
the parameter `?pn` is not equivalent to the parameter `?PN`. `_param-name_` can be preceded by a
question mark (`?`), such as `?_param-name_`.
+
If you do not specify a parameter name, all of the parameter values in the current session are cleared.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* To clear several parameter values but not all, you must use a separate `RESET PARAM` command for each parameter.

=== Example

* This command clears the setting of the `?sal` (`salary`) parameter, and the `SET PARAM` command resets it to a new value:
+
```
SQL> RESET PARAM ?sal +
SQL> SET PARAM ?sal 80000.00
```

[[cmd_run]]
== RUN Command

The `RUN` command executes the previously executed SQL statement. This command does not repeat an interface command.

=== Syntax

```

The `SAVEHIST` command saves the session history in a user-specified file. The session history consists of a list of the commands that were
executed in the TrafCI session before the SAVEHIST command.

=== Syntax

```
SAVEHIST file-name [CLEAR]
```

* `_file-name_`
+
is the name of a file into which TrafCI stores the session history. If you want the history file to exist outside the local directory where you
launch TrafCI (by default, the `bin` directory), specify the full directory path of the history file. The specified directory must exist
before you execute the `SAVEHIST` command.

* `CLEAR`
+
instructs TrafCI to clear the contents of the specified file before adding the session history to the file.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* If the specified file already exists, TrafCI appends newer session-history information to the file.

=== Examples

* This command clears the contents of an existing file named `history.txt` in the local directory (the same directory where you are running TrafCI)
and saves the session history in the file:
+
```
SQL> SAVEHIST history.txt CLEAR
SQL> 
```

* This command saves the session history in a file named `hist.txt` in the specified directory on a Windows workstation:
+
```
SQL> SAVEHIST c:\log_files\hist.txt
SQL> 
```

<<<
* This command saves the session history in a file named `hist.txt` in the specified directory on a Linux or UNIX workstation:
+
```
SQL> SAVEHIST ./log_files/hist.txt
SQL> 
```

[[cmd_set_colsep]]
== SET COLSEP Command

The `SET COLSEP` command sets the column separator and allows you to control the formatting of the result displayed for
SQL queries. The `SET COLSEP` command specifies a delimiter value to use for separating columns in each row of the results.
The default delimiter is " "(white space).

=== Syntax

```
SET COLSEP [separator]
```

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line.
* The `SET COLSEP` command has no effect if the markup is set to `HTML`,`XML`, or `CSV`.

=== Examples

* This command specifies the separator as a "`|`"(pipe):
+
```
SQL> SET COLSEP |
SQL> SHOW COLSEP
COLSEP "|"
SQL> SELECT * FROM employee;

EMPNUM|EMPNAME       |REGNUM|BRANCHNUM|JOB
------|--------------|------|---------|--------

[[cmd_set_fetchsize]]
== SET FETCHSIZE Command

The `SET FETCHSIZE` command allows you to change the default fetchsize used by JDBC. Setting the value to `0` sets the
fetchsize to the default value used in JDBC.

=== Syntax

```
SET FETCHSIZE _value_
```

* `_value_`
+
is an integer representing the fetch size as a number of rows. Zero (`0`) represents the default value of fetch size set in JDBC.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line.
* The command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Examples

* This command sets the fetchsize to `1`:
+
```
SQL> SET FETCHSIZE 1
SQL> SHOW FETCHSIZE

FETCHSIZE 1

SQL> SELECT * FROM stream(t1);

[[set_histopt]]
== SET HISTOPT Command

The `SET HISTOPT` command sets the history option and controls how commands are added to the history buffer.
By default, commands within a script file are not added to history. If the history option is set to `ALL`,
then all the commands in the script file are added to the history buffer. If no options are specified,
`DEFAULT` is used.

=== Syntax

```
SET HISTOPT [ ALL | DEFAULT ]
```

=== Considerations

You must enter the command on one line.

<<<
=== Examples

* This command shows only the obey commands added to the history buffer.

[[cmd_set_idletimeout]]
== SET IDLETIMEOUT Command

The `SET IDLETIMEOUT` command sets the idle timeout value for the current session. The idle timeout value
of a session determines when the session expires after a period of inactivity. The default is `30 minutes`.

=== Syntax

```
SET IDLETIMEOUT value
```

* `_value_`
+
is an integer representing the idle timeout value in minutes. Zero represents an infinite amount of time, meaning that
the session never expires.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* If you execute this command in a script file, it affects the session in which the script file runs. You can specify
this command in `PRUN` script files. However, running this command from a `PRUN` script file does not affect the idle
timeout value for the current session.
* To reset the default timeout value, enter this command:
+
```
SET IDLETIMEOUT 30
```

<<<
=== Examples

* This command sets the idle timeout value to four hours:
+
```
SQL> SET IDLETIMEOUT 240
```

* This command sets the idle timeout value to an infinite amount of time so that the session never expires:
+
```
SQL> SET IDLETIMEOUT 0

<<<
[[cmd_set_list_count]]
== SET LIST_COUNT Command

The `SET LIST_COUNT` command sets the maximum number of rows to be returned by `SELECT` statements that are executed
after this command. The default is zero, which means that all rows are returned.

=== Syntax

```
SET LIST_COUNT num-rows
```

* `_num-rows_`
+
is a positive integer that specifies the maximum number of rows of data to be displayed by `SELECT` statements that
are executed after this command. Zero means that all rows of data are returned.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* To reset the number of displayed rows, enter this command:
+
```
SET LIST_COUNT 0
```

=== Examples

* This command specifies that the number of rows to be displayed by `SELECT` statements is five:

[[cmd_set_markup]]
== SET MARKUP Command

The `SET MARKUP` command sets the markup format and controls how results are displayed by TrafCI.

=== Syntax

```
SET MARKUP [ RAW | HTML | XML | CSV | COLSEP ]
```

The supported options enable results to be displayed in `XML`, `HTML`, `CSV` (Comma Separated Values), and `COLSEP` format.
The default format is `RAW`.

=== Considerations


* You must enter the command on one line.
* If the `MARKUP` format is `CSV` or `COLSEP`, the column header information and status messages are not displayed.
* For the `XML` and `HTML` markup format, the syntax and interface errors is consistent `XML`
and `HTML` markup is displayed.
* For `XML` markup, any occurrence of `]]>` that appear in the error message or invalid query are replaced with `]]>`.
* When error messages are output as `HTML` markup, both the `>` (greater than) and `<` (less than) symbols are
replaced with their escaped versions: `>` and `<`, respectively. An example of the formatted error messages are show below.

[[cmd_set_param]]
== SET PARAM Command

The `SET PARAM` command associates a parameter name with a parameter value in the current session.
The parameter name and value are associated with one of these parameter types:

* Named parameter (represented by `?_param-name_`) in a DML statement or in a prepared SQL statement
* Unnamed parameter (represented by `?`) in a prepared SQL statement only

A prepared statement is one that you SQL compile by using the PREPARE statement.
For more information about PREPARE, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[_{project-name} SQL Reference Manual_].

After running `SET PARAM` commands in the session:

* You can specify named parameters (`?_param-name_`) in a DML statement.
* You can execute a prepared statement with named parameters by using the `EXECUTE` statement without a `USING` clause.
* You can execute a prepared statement with unnamed parameters by using the `EXECUTE` statement with a `USING` clause
that contains literal values and/or a list of the named parameters set by `SET PARAM`.

The `EXECUTE` statement substitutes parameter values for the parameters in the prepared statement. For more information about `EXECUTE`, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[_{project-name} SQL Reference Manual_].

<<<
=== Syntax

```
SET PARAM param-name [UTF8] param-value
```

* `_param-name_`
+
is the name of the parameter for which a value is specified. Parameter names are case-sensitive.
For example, the parameter `?pn` is not equivalent to the parameter `?PN`. `_param-name_` can be
preceded by a question mark (`?`), such as `?_param-name_`.

* `UTF8`
+
specifies that a character string specified for the parameter value, `_param-value_`, uses the
`UTF8` character set. If the character string is in `UTF8` format, it must be prefixed by `UTF8`.

* `_param-value_`
+
is a numeric or character literal that specifies the value for the parameter. If you do not specify a value,
TrafCI returns an error.
+
If `_param-value_` is a character literal and the target column type is a character string, you do not have
to enclose the value in single quotation marks. Its data type is determined from the data type of the column
to which the literal is assigned. Character strings specified as parameter values are always case-sensitive
even if they are not enclosed in quotation marks. If the character string is in `UTF8` format, it must
be prefixed by `UTF8`.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* Use separate `SET PARAM` commands to name and assign values to each unique parameter in a prepared SQL
statement before running the `EXECUTE` statement.
* Parameter names are case-sensitive. If you specify a parameter name in lowercase in the `SET PARAM` command,
you must specify it in lowercase in other statements, such as DML statements or `EXECUTE`.
* The name of a named parameter (`?_param-name_`) in a DML statement must be identical to the parameter name
(`_param-name_`) that you specify in a `SET PARAM` command.

<<<
=== Examples

* This command sets a value for the `?sal` (`salary`) parameter:
+
```
SQL> SET PARAM ?sal 40000.00
```

* This command sets a character string value, `GREEN`, for the `?lastname` parameter:
+
```
SQL> SET PARAM ?lastname GREEN
```

* These commands set values for named parameters in a subsequent `SELECT` statement:
+
```
SQL> SET PARAM ?sal 80000.00
SQL> SET PARAM ?job 100
SQL> SELECT * FROM persnl.employee WHERE salary = ?sal AND jobcode = ?job;

--- 1 row(s) selected.

SQL> 
```
+
NOTE: The names of the named parameters, `?sal` and `?job`, in the `SELECT` statement are
identical to the parameter `names`, `sal` and `job`, in the `SET PARAM` command.

* This command sets a character string value, `Pe&#241;a`, which is in `UTF8` format,
for the `?lastname` parameter:
+
```
SQL> SET PARAM ?lastname UTF8'Pe&#241;a'
```

* This command sets a character string value, which uses the `UTF8` character set and is in
hexadecimal notation, for the `?lastname` parameter:
+
```
SQL> SET PARAM ?lastname UTF8x'5065266e74696c64653b61'

* If the `SET TIMING` command is set to `ON`, the elapsed time information is displayed.

=== Example


* This command displays the elapsed time information because the `SET TIMING` command is enabled:
+
```
SQL> SET TIMING ON
SQL> SHOW TIME

TIME OFF

Elapsed :00:00:00.000

[[cmd_spool]]
== SPOOL Command

The `SPOOL` command logs the entered commands and their output from TrafCI to a log file.

=== Syntax

```
SPOOL { ON [ CLEAR, QUIET, CMDTEXT { ON | OFF } ]
      | log-file [ CLEAR, QUIET, CMDTEXT { ON | OFF } ]
      | OFF
      }
```

* `ON`
+
starts the logging process and records information in the `sqlspool.lst` file in the `bin directory. 

* `ON CLEAR`
+
instructs TrafCI to clear the contents of the `sqlspool.lst` file before logging new information to the file.

* `QUIET`
+
specifies that the command text is displayed on the screen, but the results of the command are written only to 
the log file and not to the screen.

* `CMDTEXT ON`
+
specifies that the command text and the log header are displayed in the log file.

* `CMDTEXT OFF`
+
specifies that the command text and the log header are not displayed in the log file.

* `_log-file_`
+
is the name of a log file into which TrafCI records the entered commands and their output. If you want the log file 
to exist outside the local directory where you launch TrafCI (by default, the `bin` directory), then specify the 
full directory path of the log file. The log file does not need to exist, but the specified directory must exist 
before you execute the `SPOOL` command.

* `_log-file_ CLEAR`
+
instructs TrafCI to clear the contents of the specified `_log-file_` before logging new information to the file.

* `OFF`
+
stops the logging process.

=== Considerations

* You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.
* Use a unique name for each log file to avoid writing information from different TrafCI sessions into the same log file.

=== Examples

* This command starts the logging process and records information to the `sqlspool.lst` file in the `bin` directory:
+
```
SQL> SPOOL ON
```

* This command starts the logging process and appends new information to an existing log file, `persnl_updates.log`, 
in the local directory (the same directory where you are running TrafCI):
+
```
SQL> SPOOL persnl_updates.log
```

* This command starts the logging process and appends new information to a log file, `sales_updates.log`, in the 
specified directory on a Windows workstation:
+
```
SQL> SPOOL c:\log_files\sales_updates.log
```

* This command starts the logging process and appends new information to a log file, `sales_updates.log`, 
in the specified directory on a Linux or UNIX workstation:
+
```
SQL> SPOOL ./log_files/sales_updates.log
```

* This command starts the logging process and clears existing information from the log file before logging 
new information to the file:
+
```
SQL> SPOOL persnl_ddl.log CLEAR
```

<<<

[[cmd_version]]
== VERSION Command

The `VERSION` command displays the build versions of the {project-name} database, {project-name} Connectivity Service, 
{project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver, and TrafCI.

=== Syntax

```
VERSION
```

=== Considerations

You must enter the command on one line. The command does not require an SQL terminator.

=== Example

* This command shows versions of the {project-name} database, {project-name} Connectivity Service, {project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver, and TrafCI:
+
```
SQL> VERSION

Trafodion Platform              : Release 0.8.0
Trafodion Connectivity Services : Version 1.0.0 Release 0.8.0 
Trafodion JDBC Type 4 Driver    : Traf_JDBC_Type4_Build_40646) 
Trafodion Command Interface     : TrafCI_Build_40646

SQL> 
```

<<<
* If TrafCI is started with the -noconnect parameter, the `VERSION` command displays only TrafCI and the 
{project-name} JDBC Type 4 Driver versions.
