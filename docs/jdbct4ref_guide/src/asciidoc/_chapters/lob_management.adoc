= Managing the SQL Tables for BLOB and CLOB Data

This chapter describes for database administrators the creation and
management of the tables required to support LOB data.

NOTE: BLOB and CLOB are not native data types in a {project-name}
database. But database administrators can create SQL base tables that
have BLOB and CLOB columns by using either the Type 4 driver or special
SQL syntax in as described in this chapter.

For management purposes, CLOB and BLOB data is referred to as large
object (LOB) data, which can represent either data type.

[[before-you-begin-managing-lob-data]]
== Before You Begin Managing LOB Data

Before reading this chapter, also read
<<Architecture for LOB Support, Architecture for LOB Support>>,
which describes the files for the tables that contain LOB data.

[creating-base-tables-that-have-lob-columns]]
== Creating Base Tables that Have LOB Columns

You can use trafci or write JDBC programs to create base tables that have LOB columns.

[[data-types-for-lob-columns]]
=== Data Types for LOB Columns

The data types for the LOB columns are:

* `CLOB`: Character large object data
* `BLOB`: Binary large object data

NOTE: The CLOB and BLOB data type specification is special syntax that
is allowed for use in base tables accessed by the Type 4 driver as
described in this manual.

[[using-trafci-to-create-base-tables-that-have-lob-columns]]
=== Using trafci To Create Base Tables that Have LOB Columns

To create a base table that has LOB columns using trafci:

1.  Type this special commands in to enable creating tables that have LOB columns:
+
```
CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT TRAF_BLOB_AS_VARCHAR 'OFF' ; 
CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT TRAF_CLOB_AS_VARCHAR 'OFF' ; 
```

2.  Type the CREATE TABLE statement; for example, you might use the
following simple form of the statement:
+
```
CREATE TABLE table1
( c1 INTEGER NOT NULL
, c2 CLOB
, c3 BLOB
, PRIMARY KEY( c1 )
)
;
```
+
* `table1`: The name of the base table.
+
NOTE: If different LOB tables are used for storing BLOB or CLOB data,
the base table name for a table with BLOB or CLOB columns must be unique
across all catalogs and schemas. Otherwise, the driver will give
incorrect data to the application in cases where the LOB tables used get
erroneously switched or changed.
* `c1 Column 1`: Defined as the INTEGER data type with the NOT NULL constraint.
* `c2 Column 2`: Defined as the CLOB data type.
* `c3 Column 3`: Defined as the BLOB data type.
* `PRIMARY KEY`: Specifies `c1` as the primary key.

Use this example as the archetype for creating base tables. For
information about valid names for tables (`table1`) and
columns (`c1`, `c2`, and `c3`) and for information about the CREATE TABLE statement, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual].

[[using-jdbc-programs-to-create-base-tables-that-have-lob-columns]]
=== Using JDBC Programs To Create Base Tables that Have LOB Columns

When using a JDBC Program to create base tables that have LOB columns,
put the CREATE TABLE statements in the program as you would any other
SQL statement. For an example of the CREATE TABLE statement, see the discussion
<<using-trafci-to-create-base-tables-that-have-lob-columns, Using trafci To Create Base Tables that Have LOB Columns>> .

[[managing-lob-data-by-using-the-lob-admin-utility]]
== Managing LOB Data by Using the Lob Admin Utility

Use the Lob Admin Utility (T4LobAdmin) for the following tasks:

* Creating the LOB table (a table that holds LOB data).
* Creating the SQL triggers for the LOB columns in the base tables to ensure that orphan LOB data does not occur in a LOB table.

NOTE: If you are creating triggers, ensure that the base table that
contains the CLOB column or BLOB column has already been created.

Information about using the Lob Admin Utility is described under these topics.

[[running-the-lob-admin-utility]]
=== Running the Lob Admin Utility

Run the T4LobAdmin utility from the workstation. The format of the
command is:

```
java [java_options] org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4LobAdmin [prog_options] [table_name]
```

[[java-options]]
==== java_options

The `java_options` should specify the Type 4 driver properties in a
properties file on the java command line in the `-D` option.

```
-Dhpt4jdbc.properties=<properties file name>
```

where the properties file should include the following Type 4 driver properties, as applicable:

[cols="25%,75%",options="header" ]
|===
| Property        | Description
| `blobtablename` | Specifies LOB table for BLOB columns. Required if BLOB columns are involved. See <<lob-table-name-properties, LOB Table Name Properties>>.
| `clobTableName` | Specifies the LOB table for CLOB columns. Required if CLOB columns are involved. See <<lob-table-name-properties, LOB Table Name Properties>>.
| `url`           | URL for the Type 4 driver connection. See <<url,url Property>>.
| `usr`           | User name for the Type 4 driver connection. See <<user, user Property>>.
| `password`      | Password associated with the user. See <<password, password Property>>.
|===

[[program-options]]
==== program_options

[cols="25%,75%",options="header" ]
|===
| prog_option        | Description
| `-help`            | Displays help information
| `-exec`            | Runs the SQL statements that are generated.
| `-create`          | Generates SQL statements to create LOB tables. These statements describe the architecture of the tables and, therefore, provide a description of the LOB tables.
|===

[[table-name]]
==== table_name

The *table_name* represents a base table that contains LOB columns. The
*table_name* is of the form:

```
[catalogName.][schemaName.]baseTableName
```

For information about catalog, schema, and table names, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual].

[[help-listing-from-the-type-4-lob-admin-utility]]
=== Help Listing From the Type 4 Lob Admin Utility

To display help for the Type 4 Lob Admin Utility, type:

```
java org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4LobAdmin -help
```

*Example*

```
Apache Trafodion T4 Lob Admin Utility 1.0 (c) Copyright 2015-2016
org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4LobAdmin [<prog_options>] [<table_name>]

<java_options> is:
     [-Dhpt4jdbc.properties=<properties file>]
where <properties file> has values for the following:
     clobTableName - CLOB table name
     blobTableName - BLOB table name
     url - URL used for the Type 4 connection
     user - User name for the Type 4 connection
     password - Password for associated with the user

<prog_options> is:
    [-exec] [-create] [-trigger] [-help] [-drop] [-out <filename>]
where -help    - Display this information.
      -exec    - Execute the SQL statements that are generated.
      -create  - Generate SQL statements to create LOB tables.
      -trigger - Generate SQL statements to create triggers for <table_name>.
      -drop    - Generate SQL statements to drop triggers for <table_name>.
      -out     - Write the SQL statements to <filename>.

<clobTableName> | <blobTableName> is:
    <catalogName>.<schemaName>.<lobTableName>

<table_name> is:
    [<catalogName>.][<schemaName>.]<baseTableName>

<baseTableName> is the table that contains LOB column(s). TableName> is the
table that contains the LOB data.
```

[[creating-lob-tables]]
=== Creating LOB Tables

Except as noted below, use the `-create` and `-execute` options of the Lob
Admin Utility to create LOB tables.

NOTE: Partitioned LOB tables must be manually created. You cannot use
the Lob Admin Utility if your site needs partitioned LOB tables. Do not
use the -execute option of the Lob Admin Utility. Follow these steps to
manually create partitioned LOB tables:

1.  Use the `-create` and `-out` options of the Lob Admin Utility to have SQL statements written to a file.
2.  Modify the generated SQL statements as needed for your partitioning requirements.
3.  Add the modified SQL statements to a trafci obey file.
4.  Run the script file from trafci by using obey command.

[[using-sql-triggers-to-delete-lob-data]]
=== Using SQL Triggers to Delete LOB Data

Use the Type 4 Lob Admin Utility to generate triggers on SQL tables that
delete LOB data from the LOB table when the base row is deleted. These
triggers ensure that orphan LOB data does not occur in the LOB table. To
manage the triggers, use these Type 4 Lob Admin Utility options:

* `-trigger`: Generates SQL statements to create triggers.
* `-drop`: Generates SQL statements to drop triggers.
* `-exec`: Executes the SQL statements that are generated.

For example, the following command generates the SQL statements to
create the triggers for the base table `sales.paris.pictures`, which
contains a BLOB column, and executes those statements.

```
java -Dhpt4jdbc.blobTableName=sales.paris.lobTable4pictures /
org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4LobAdmin -trigger -exec sales.paris.pictures
```

[[limitations-of-lob-data-clob-and-blob-data-types]]
=== Limitations of LOB Data (CLOB and BLOB Data Types)

Limitations of the CLOB and BLOB data types, collectively referred to as LOB data, are:

* LOB columns can only be in the target column list of these SQL statements:

** INSERT statement.

** Select list of a SELECT statement.

** Column name in the SET clause of an UPDATE statement.

* LOB columns cannot be referenced in the SQL functions and expressions.

* LOB data is not deleted from the LOB table when the base row is deleted unless a trigger is established. For information about triggers,
see <<using-sql-triggers-to-delete-lob-data, Using SQL Triggers to Delete LOB Data>>

* LOB data is not accessible if the base table name is changed.

* The name of a base table that has CLOB or BLOB columns must be unique across all catalogs and schemas when more than one of these base tables
share a single LOB table.
+
NOTE: Adding a trigger can affect up to three schemas. For each schema, you must either own the schema or be the super ID. +
 +
* The schema where the trigger is created.
* The schema where the subject table (LOB table) exists.
* The schema where the referenced table (base table) exists.
