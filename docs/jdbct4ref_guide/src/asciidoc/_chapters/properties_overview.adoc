[[how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties]]
== How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties

The Type 4 JDBC driver properties configure the driver. These properties
can be specified in a data source, a connection URL (the primary IP
address or host name on the database), a properties file,
or in the java command line.

Java properties have the form:

```
key=value
```

At run time, the driver looks for a specific set of property keys and
takes action based on their associated values.

<<<
[[where-to-set-properties]]
=== Where to Set Properties

* For connections made through a `DataSource` or a `ConnectionPoolDataSource`,
set the property on the `DataSource` or the `ConnectionPoolDataSource` object.

* For the `DriverManager` class, set properties in either of two ways:
+
1. Using the option `-Dproperty_name=property_value` in the command line.
2. Using the `java.util.Properties` parameter in the `getConnection()` method
of the `DriverManager` class.

[[creating-and-using-a-properties-file]]
=== Creating and Using a Properties File

JDBC applications can provide property values to configure a connection
by using a file that contains properties for the JDBC driver. This
property file is passed as a java command-line parameter. The format to
enter the properties file in the command line is:

```
-Dt4jdbc.properties=<path of the properties file on disk>`
```

*Example*

```
-Dt4jdbc.properties=C:\temp\t4props\myprops.properties
```

To create the file, use the editor of your choice on your workstation to
type in the property values. The entries in properties file must have a
`property_name=property_value` value-pair format:

```
property_name=property_value
```

*Example*

```
maxStatements=1024
```

To configure a `DataSource` connection, the properties file might contain
property names and values as indicated in the following list:

```
url=jdbc:t4jdbc://<primary IP addr or host name of database>:23400/
user=database_username
password=mypassword
description=<a string>
catalog=TRAFODION
schema=myschema
maxPoolSize=20
minPoolSize=5
maxStatements=20
loginTimeout=15
initialPoolSize=10
connectionTimeout=10
T4LogLevel=OFF
T4LogFile=/mylogdirectory/mylogfile
```

[[setting-properties-in-the-command-line]]
=== Setting Properties in the Command Line

When a Type 4 driver property is specified on the command line through
the java `-D` option, the property must include the prefix: `t4jdbc`.

This notation, which includes the period (.), ensures that all the Type
4 driver property names are unique for a Java application.

*Example*

The maxStatements property becomes:

```
-Dt4jdbc.maxStatements=10
```

[[precedence-of-property-specifications]]
=== Precedence of Property Specifications

If a particular property is set several ways by an application, the
value used depends on how the value was set according to the following
order of precedence:

1.  Set on the `DataSource` object, `DriverManager` object, or
`ConnectionPoolDataSource` object.

2.  Set through the `java.util.Properties` parameter in the `getConnection`
method of `DriverManager` class.

3.  Set the property in a properties file specified by the
`t4jdbc.properties` property.

4.  Set the `-Dt4jdbc.property_name=<property value>` in the java command line.

For more information, see order of precedence for properties specified
in various ways for use with the Driver Manager.
