[[working-with-blob-and-clob-data]]
= Working with BLOB and CLOB Data

This chapter describes working with BLOB and CLOB data in JDBC
applications. You can use the standard interface described in the JDBC
3.0 API specification to access BLOB and CLOB data in a {project-name}
database with support provided by the Type 4 driver.

BLOB and CLOB are not native data types in a {project-name} database.
But, database administrators can create and manage {project-name}
database tables that have BLOB and CLOB columns by using the Type 4
driver or other tools as described in
<<managing-the-sql-tables-for-blob-and-clob-data, Managing the SQL Tables for BLOB and CLOB Data>>.

For management purposes, CLOB and BLOB data is referred to as large
object (LOB) data, which can represent either data type.

[[architecture-for-lob-support]]
== Architecture for LOB Support

The tables that support LOB data are:

*LOB Architecture: Tables for LOB Data Support*
[cols="15%,85%",options="header" ]
|===
| Table | Description
| *Base table* | Referenced by JDBC applications to insert, store, read, and update BLOB and CLOB data.
In the base table, the Type 4 driver maps the BLOB and CLOB columns into a data-locator column. The data-locator column points to
the actual LOB data that is stored in a separate user table called the LOB table.
| *LOB table* | Actually contains the BLOB and CLOB data in chunks. A CLOB or BLOB object is identified by a data locator. LOB tables have two
formats: LOB table for BLOB data and a LOB table for CLOB data.
|===

[[setting-properties-for-the-lob-table]]
== Setting Properties for the LOB Table

Before running the JDBC application that uses BLOB and CLOB data through
the JDBC API, the database administrator must create the LOB tables. For
information on creating LOB tables, see
<<managing-lob-data-by-using-the-lob-admin-utility, Managing LOB Data by Using the Lob Admin Utility>>.

The JDBC applications that access BLOB or CLOB data must specify the
associated LOB table names and, optionally, configure the
`reserveDataLocators` property.

[[specifying-the-lob-table]]
=== Specifying the LOB Table

At run time, a user JDBC application notifies the Type 4 driver of the
name or names of the LOB tables associated with the CLOB or BLOB columns
of the base tables being accessed by the application. One LOB table or
separate tables can be used for BLOB and CLOB data.

The JDBC application specifies a LOB table name either through a system
parameter or through a Java Property object by using one of the
following properties, depending on the LOB column type:

For more information about using these properties, see
<<lob-table-name-properties, LOB Table Name Properties>>.

[[reserving-data-locators]]
=== Reserving Data Locators

A data locator is the reference pointer value (SQL `LARGEINT` data type)
that is substituted for the BLOB or CLOB column in the base table
definition. Each object stored into the LOB table is assigned a unique
data locator value. Because the LOB table is a shared resource among all
accessors that use the particular LOB table, reserving data locators
reduces contention for getting the next value. The default setting is
100 reserved data locators; therefore, each JVM instance can insert 100
large objects (not chunks) before needing a new allocation.

Specify the number of data locators (n) to reserve for your application
by using the Type 4 driver property `t4jdbc.reserveDataLocator`. For
information about specifying this property, see
<<reserveDataLocators, reserveDataLocators Property>>.


[[storing-clob-data]]
== Storing CLOB Data

[[inserting-clob-columns-by-using-the-clob-interface]]
=== Inserting CLOB Columns by Using the Clob Interface

When you insert a row containing a CLOB data type, and before the column
can be updated with real CLOB data, you can insert a row that has an
empty CLOB value. To insert an empty CLOB value in a {project-name}
database, specify the `EMPTY_CLOB()` function for the CLOB column in the
insert statement.

* The `EMPTY_CLOB()` function is an {project-name} database software-specific
function and might not work on other databases.

* Do not use the `EMPTY_CLOB()` function when using the `PreparedStatement` interface.

The Type 4 driver scans the SQL string for the `EMPTY_CLOB()` function and
substitutes the next-available data locator.

Then, obtain the handle to the empty CLOB column by selecting the CLOB
column for update. The following code illustrates how to obtain the
handle to an empty CLOB column:

[source, java]
----
Clob myClob = null ;

Statement s = conn.createStatement() ;
ResultSet rs =
   s.executeQuery( "SELECT myclobcolumn FROM mytable WHERE ... FOR UPDATE" ) ;
if ( rs.next() )
   myCLOB = rs.getClob( 1 ) ;
----

You can now write data to the CLOB column. See
<<writing-ascii-or-mbcs-data-to-a-clob-column, Writing ASCII or MBCS Data to a CLOB Column>>.

NOTE: *Limitation*: Do not rename the CLOB column in the select query.

[[writing-ascii-or-mbcs-data-to-a-clob-column]]
=== Writing ASCII or MBCS Data to a CLOB Column

You can write ASCII or MBCS data to a CLOB column.

NOTE: Multi-byte Character Set (MBCS) data and ASCII data are handled the same way.

[[ascii-data]]
==== ASCII Data

To write ASCII or MBCS data to the CLOB column, use the Clob interface.
The following code illustrates using the `setAsciiStream` method of the
Clob interface to write CLOB data.

[source, java]
----
// stream begins at position: 1
long pos = 1;

// String containing the ASCII data
String s ;

// Obtain the output stream to write Clob data
OutputStream os = myClob.setAsciiStream( pos ) ;

// write Clob data using OutputStream
byte[] myClobData = s.getBytes() ;
os.write( myClobData ) ;
----

The Type 4 driver splits the output stream into chunks and stores the
chunks in the LOB table.


[[inserting-clob-data-by-using-the-preparedstatement-interface]]
=== Inserting CLOB Data by Using the PreparedStatement Interface

You can use the `PreparedStatement` interface to insert a CLOB column
using ASCII or MBCS data.

[[ascii-data]]
==== ASCII Data

To insert a CLOB column using ASCII or MBCS data from an `InputStream`,
use the `PreparedStatement` interface to insert the CLOB column.

[source, java]
----
InputStream inputAsciiStream ;

PreparedStatement ps =
   conn.prepareStatement( "INSERT INTO mytable (myclobcolumn) VALUES (?)" ) ;

ps.setAsciiStream( 1, inputAsciiStream, length_of_data ) ;
ps.executeUpdate() ;
----

The Type 4 driver reads the data from `InputStream` and writes the data to
the LOB table. The Type 4 driver substitutes the next-available data
locator for the parameter of the CLOB column in the table.

[[inserting-a-clob-object-by-using-the-setclob-method]]
=== Inserting a Clob Object by Using the setClob Method

Your JDBC application cannot directly instantiate a `Clob` object. To
perform an equivalent operation:

1.  Obtain a `Clob` object by using the `getClob` method of the `ResultSet` interface.
2.  Insert the `Clob` object into another row by using the `setClob` method
of the `PreparedStatement` interface.

In this situation, the Type 4 driver generates a new data locator and,
when the `PreparedStatement` is executed, copies the contents of the source `Clob`
into the new `Clob` object.

[[reading-clob-data]]
== Reading CLOB Data

[[reading-ascii-data-from-a-clob-column]]
=== Reading ASCII Data from a CLOB Column

To read ASCII or MBCS data from a CLOB column, use the `Clob` interface or `InputStream`.

Using the Clob interface:

[source, java]
----
// Obtain the Clob from ResultSet
Clob myClob = rs.getClob( "myClobColumn" ) ;

// Obtain the input stream to read Clob data
InputStream is = myClob.getAsciiStream() ;

// read Clob data using the InputStream
byte[] myClobData ;
myClobData = new byte[ length ] ;

is.read( myClobData, offset, length ) ;
----

To read ASCII or MBCS data from the CLOB column by using `InputStream`:

[source, java]
----
// obtain the InputStream from ResultSet
InputStream is = rs.getAsciiStream( "myClobColumn" ) ;

// read Clob data using the InputStream
byte[] myClobData ;
myClobData = new byte[length] ;

is.read( myClobData, offset, length ) ;
----

[[updating-clob-data]]
== Updating CLOB Data

To update CLOB data, use the methods in the `Clob` interface or use the
`updateClob` method of the `ResultSet` interface. The Type 4 driver makes
changes directly to the CLOB data. Therefore, the Type 4 driver returns
`false` to the `locatorsUpdateCopy` method of the `DatabaseMetaData` interface.
Applications do not need to issue a separate update statement to update the CLOB data.

[[updating-clob-objects-with-the-updateclob-method]]
=== Updating Clob Objects with the updateClob Method

Unlike some LOB support implementations, the Type 4 driver updates the
CLOB data directly in the database. So, when the `Clob` object is same in
the `updateClob` method as the `Clob` object obtained using `getClob`, the
`updateRow` method of the `ResultSet` interface does nothing with the `Clob`
object.

When the `Clob` objects differ, then the `Clob` object in the `updateClob` method
behaves as if the `setClob` method was issued. See
<<inserting-a-clob-object-by-using-the-setclob-method, Inserting a Clob Object by Using the setClob Method>>.

[[replacing-clob-objects]]
=== Replacing Clob Objects

You can replace Clob objects in the following ways:

* Use the `EMPTY_CLOB()` function to replace the `Clob` object with the
empty `Clob` object, then insert new data as described under
<<inserting-clob-columns-by-using-the-clob-interface, Inserting CLOB Columns by Using the Clob Interface>>.
* Use the `PreparedStatement.setAsciiStream()` or `setCharacterStream()`
method to replace the existing `Clob` object with new CLOB data.
* Use the `setClob` or `updateClob` method to replace the existing CLOB
objects as explained under
<<inserting-a-clob-object-by-using-the-setclob-method, Inserting a Clob Object by Using the setClob Method>> and
<<updating-clob-objects-with-the-updateclob-method, Updating Clob Objects with the updateClob Method>>.

[[deleting-clob-data]]
== Deleting CLOB Data

To delete CLOB data, the JDBC application uses the `SQL DELETE` statement
to delete the row in the base table.

When the row containing the CLOB column is deleted by the JDBC
application, the corresponding CLOB data is automatically deleted, too.

See also
<<null-and-empty-blob-or-empty-clob-value, NULL and Empty BLOB or Empty CLOB Value>>.

[[storing-blob-data]]
== Storing BLOB Data

Perform operations on BLOB columns that are similar to those operations
used on CLOB columns.

* Use the `EMPTY_BLOB()` function in the insert statement to create an
empty BLOB column in the database.
* Use the `setBinaryStream` method of the `Blob` interface to obtain the
`InputStream` to read BLOB data.
* Use the `getBinaryStream` method of the `Blob` interface to obtain the
`OutputStream` to write BLOB data.
* Use the `setBinaryStream` of the `PreparedStatement` interface to write the
data to the BLOB column.

[[inserting-a-blob-column-by-using-the-blob-interface]]
=== Inserting a BLOB Column by Using the Blob Interface

When you insert a row containing a BLOB data type, you can insert the
row using an empty BLOB value before the column can be updated with real
BLOB data. To insert an empty BLOB value in a {project-name} database,
specify `EMPTY_BLOB()` function for the BLOB column in the insert
statement.

The Type 4 driver scans the SQL string for the `EMPTY_BLOB()` function and
substitutes the next-available data locator.

NOTE: The `EMPTY_BLOB()` function is an {project-name} database software
specific function and might not work on other databases. Do not use the `EMPTY_BLOB()` function when using the `PreparedStatement`
interface.

Then, obtain the handle to the empty BLOB column by selecting the BLOB
column for update. The following code illustrates how to obtain the
handle to an empty BLOB column:

[source, java]
----
Blob myBlob = null ;

Statement s = conn.createStatement() ;
ResultSet rs =
   s.executeQuery("SELECT myblobcolumn FROM mytable WHERE ... FOR UPDATE" ) ;

if ( rs.next() )
   myBlob = rs.getBlob( 1 ) ;
----

You can now write data to the BLOB column. See
<<writing-binary-data-to-a-blob-column, Writing Binary Data to a BLOB Column>>.

NOTE: *Limitation:* Do not rename the BLOB column in the select query.

[[writing-binary-data-to-a-blob-column]]
=== Writing Binary Data to a BLOB Column

To write data to the BLOB column, use the `Blob` interface. The following
code illustrates using the `setBinaryStream` method of the `Blob` interface
to write BLOB data:

[source, java]
----
// Stream begins at position: 1
long pos = 1 ;

// String containing the binary data
String s ;

// Obtain the output stream to write Blob data
OutputStream os = myBlob.setBinaryStream( pos ) ;

// write Blob data using OutputStream
byte[] myBlobData = s.getBytes() ;
os.write( myBlobData ) ;
----

The Type 4 driver splits the output stream into chunks and stores the chunks in the LOB table.

[[inserting-a-blob-column-by-using-the-preparedstatement-interface]]
=== Inserting a BLOB Column by Using the PreparedStatement Interface

To insert a BLOB column that has binary data from an `InputStream`, use
the `PreparedStatement` interface:

[source, java]
----
InputStream inputBinary ;

PreparedStatement ps =
   conn.prepareStatement( "INSERT INTO mytable (myblobcolumn) VALUES (?)" ) ;

ps.setBinaryStream( 1, inputBinary, length_of_data ) ;
ps.executeUpdate() ;
----

The Type 4 driver reads the data from `InputStream` and writes the data to
the LOB table. The Type 4 driver substitutes the next-available data
locator for the parameter of the BLOB column in the table.

[[inserting-a-blob-object-by-using-the-setblob-method]]
=== Inserting a Blob Object by Using the setBlob Method

Your JDBC application cannot directly instantiate a `Blob` object. To
perform an equivalent operation:

1.  Obtain a `Blob` object by using the `getBlob` method of the `ResultSet` interface.
2.  Insert the `Blob` object into another row by using the `setBlob` method
of the `PreparedStatement` interface.

In this situation, the Type 4 driver generates a new data locator and
copies the contents of the source `Blob` into the new `Blob` object when the
application issues the `setBlob` method of the `PreparedStatement` interface.


[[reading-binary-data-from-a-blob-column]]
== Reading Binary Data from a BLOB Column

To read binary data from the BLOB column, use the `Blob` interface or `InputStream`.

Using the Blob interface:

[source, java]
----
// Obtain the Blob from ResultSet
Blob myBlob = rs.getBlob( "myBlobColumn" ) ;

// Obtain the input stream to read Blob data
InputStream is = myBlob.getBinaryStream() ;

// read Blob data using the InputStream
byte[] myBlobData ;
myBlobData = new byte[ length ] ;

is.read( myBlobData, offset, length ) ;
----

Using InputStream:

[source, java]
----
// obtain the InputStream from ResultSet
InputStream is = rs.getBinaryStream( "myBlobColumn" ) ;

// read Blob data using the InputStream
byte[] myBlobData ;
myBlobData = new byte[ length ] ;

is.read( myBlobData, offset, length ) ;
----

[[updating-blob-data]]
== Updating BLOB Data

To update BLOB data, use the methods in the `Blob` interface or use the
`updateBlob` method of the `ResultSet` interface. The Type 4 driver makes
changes to the BLOB data directly. Therefore, the Type 4 driver returns
`false` to the `locatorsUpdateCopy` method of the
`DatabaseMetaData` interface. Applications do not need to issue a separate
update statement to update the BLOB data.

[[updating-blob-objects-by-using-the-updateblob-method]]
=== Updating Blob Objects by Using the updateBlob Method

Unlike some LOB support implementations, the Type 4 driver updates the
BLOB data directly in the database. So, when the Blob object is same in
the `updateBlob` method as the object obtained using `getBlob`, the
`updateRow` method of the `ResultSet` interface does nothing with the `Blob`
object.

When the `Blob` objects differ, the `Blob` object in the `updateBlob` method
behaves as if the `setBlob` method was issued. See
<<inserting-a-blob-object-by-using-the-setblob-method, Inserting a Blob Object by Using the setBlob Method>>.

[[replacing-blob-objects]]
=== Replacing Blob Objects

You can replace Blob objects in the following ways:

* Use the `EMPTY_BLOB()` function to replace the `Blob` object with the
empty `Blob` object.
* Replace an existing `Blob` object in a row by inserting the `Blob` with
new data as described under
<<inserting-a-blob-column-by-using-the-blob-interface, Inserting a BLOB Column by Using the Blob Interface>>.
* Use the `setBinaryStream()` method to of the `PreparedStatement` interface
to replace the existing `Blob` object with new BLOB data.
* Use the `setBlob` or `updateBlob` methods to replace the existing BLOB
objects as explained under
<<inserting-a-blob-object-by-using-the-setblob-method, Inserting a Blob Object by Using the setBlob Method>> and
<<updating-blob-objects-by-using-the-updateblob-method, Updating Blob Objects by Using the updateBlob Method>>.

[[deleting-blob-data]]
== Deleting BLOB Data

To delete BLOB data, the JDBC application uses the `SQL DELETE` statement
to delete the row in the base table.

When the row containing the BLOB column is deleted by the application,
the corresponding BLOB data is automatically deleted.

See also
<<null-and-empty-blob-or-empty-clob-value, NULL and Empty BLOB or Empty CLOB Value>>.

[[null-and-empty-blob-or-empty-clob-value]]
== NULL and Empty BLOB or Empty CLOB Value

The data locator can have a `NULL` value if the BLOB or CLOB column is
omitted in the insert statement. The Type 4 driver returns `NULL` when the
application retrieves the value for such a column.

When the application uses the `EMPTY_BLOB()` function or the `EMPTY_CLOB()`
function to insert empty BLOB or CLOB data into the BLOB or CLOB column,
the Type 4 driver returns the `Blob` or `Clob` object with no data.

[[transactions-involving-blob-and-clob-access]]
== Transactions Involving Blob and Clob Access

You must ensure that your JDBC applications control the transactions
when the BLOB columns or CLOB columns are accessed or modified. To
control the transaction, set the connection to autocommit OFF mode.

All LOB data access or modification is done under the application's
transaction. When the autocommit mode is ON and LOB data is accessed or
modified, the Type 4 driver throws the SQLException, Autocommit is on
and LOB objects are involved.

[[access-considerations-for-clob-and-blob-objects]]
== Access Considerations for Clob and Blob Objects

The Type 4 driver allows all the valid operations on the current `Clob`
object or `Blob` object, called a "LOB object." LOB objects are current as
long as the row that contains these LOB objects is the current row. The
Type 4 driver throws an SQLException, issuing the following message,
when the application attempts to perform operations on a LOB object that
is not current:

```
Lob object {object-id} is not current
```

Only one `InputStream` or `Reader` and one `OutputStream` or `Writer` can be
associated with the current LOB object.

* When the application obtains the `InputStream` or `Reader` from the LOB
object, the Type 4 driver closes the `InputStream` or `Reader` that is
already associated with the LOB object.
* Similarly, when the application obtains the `OutputStream` or `Writer`
from the LOB object, the Type 4 driver closes the `OutputStream` or `Writer`
that is already associated with the LOB object.
