[[data-sources]]
== Data Sources

The term *data source* logically refers to a database or other data
storage entity. A JDBC (client) data source is physically a Java object that
contains properties such as the URL of the physical database, the
catalog to use when connecting to this database, and the schema to use
when connecting to this database. The JDBC data source also contains
methods for obtaining a JDBC connection to the underlying database.

[[jdbc-data-source-client-side]]
=== JDBC Data Source (client-side)

All JDBC data source classes implement either the `javax.sql.DataSource`
interface or the `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface. The Type
4 driver data source classes are `org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.HPT4DataSource` and
`org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.HPT4ConnectionPoolDataSource`. (These classes are
defined by the JDBC 3.0 specification.)

Typically, a user or system administrator uses a tool to create a data
source, and then registers the data source by using a JNDI service
provider. At run time, a user application typically retrieves the data
source through JNDI, and uses the data source's methods to establish a
connection to the underlying database.

A DataSource object maps to an instance of a database. In the Type 4
driver product, the DataSource object acts as an interface between the
application code and the database and enables connection with a DCS
(Data Connectivity Services) data source.

[[security]]
== Security

Clients connect to the {project-name} platform with a valid user name
and password, using standard JDBC 3.0 APIs. An application can make multiple
connections using different user IDs, and creating different Connection
objects.

The Type 4 driver provides for user name and password authentication.
The password is encrypted.

<<<
[[connection-by-using-the-datasource-interface]]
== Connection by Using the DataSource Interface

The `javax.sql.DataSource` interface is the preferred way to establish a
connection to the database because this interface enhances the application
portability. Portability is achieved by allowing the application to use a
logical name for a data source instead of providing driver-specific information
in the application. A logical name is mapped to a `javax.sql.DataSource`
object through a naming service that uses the Java Naming and Directory
Interface (JNDI). Using this DataSource method is particularly recommended
for application servers.

When an application requests a connection by using the `getConnection` method
in the `DataSource`, then the method returns a `Connection` object.

A `DataSource` object is a factory for `Connection` objects. An object that
implements the `DataSource` interface is typically registered with a JNDI
service provider.

[[overview-of-tasks-to-deploy-datasource-objects]]
=== Overview of Tasks to Deploy DataSource Objects

Before an application can connect to a `DataSource` object, typically
the system administrator deploys the `DataSource` object so that
the application programmers can start using it.

Data source properties are usually set by a system administrator using
a GUI tool as part of the installation of the data source. Users to
the data source do not get or set properties. Management tools can get
at properties by using introspection.

Tasks involved in creating and registering a database object are:

1. Creating an instance of the `DataSource` class.
2. Setting the properties of the `DataSource` object.
3. Registering the `DataSource` object with a naming service that uses
the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API.
 
An instance of the `DataSource` class and the `DataSource` object
properties are usually set by an application developer or system
administrator using a GUI tool as part of the installation of the
data source. If you are using an installed data source, then see
<<programmatically-creating-an-instance-of-the-datasource-class, Programmatically Creating an Instance of the DataSource Class>>.

The subsequent topics show an example of performing these tasks programmatically.

For more information about using data sources, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/sqldatasources.html[Connecting with DataSource Objects]
in the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/TOC.html[JDBC(TM) Database Access: Table of Contents] documentation
or other information available in the field.

<<<
[[datasource-object-properties]]
=== DataSource Object Properties

A `DataSource` object has properties that identify and describe the actual
data source that the object represents. These properties include such
information as the URL (the primary IP address or host name of the database),
the database schema and catalog names, the location of the database server,
the name of the database, and so forth.

For details about Type 4 driver properties that you can use with the `DataSource` object, see <<type-4-driver-properties,Type 4 Driver Properties>>.

[[programmatically-creating-an-instance-of-the-datasource-class]]
=== Programmatically Creating an Instance of the DataSource Class

A JDBC application can set `DataSource` properties programmatically and
register with a DataSource object. To get or set `DataSource` object properties programmatically, use the
appropriate getter or setter methods on the `HPT4DataSource` object or
the `HPT4ConnectionPoolDataSource` object.

*Example*

[source, java]
----
HPT4DataSource temp = new HPT4DataSource() ;
temp.setCatalog( "TRAFODION" ) ;
----

In the following example, the code fragment illustrates the methods that a
`DataSource` object `ds` needs to include if the object supports the
`serverDataSource` property `ds.setServerDataSource( "my_server_datasource" )`.
In this example, the code shows setting properties for the `HPT4DataSource` object
to use the Type 4 driver to access a {project-name} database:

[source, java]
----
HPT4DataSource ds = new HPT4DataSource() ;

ds.setUrl( "jdbc:t4jdbc://<primary IP addr or host name>:2300/" );
ds.setCatalog( "TRAFODION" ) ;
ds.setSchema( "myschema" ) ;
ds.setUser( "gunnar" ) ;
ds.setPassword( "my_userpassword" ) ;

// Properties relevant for Type 4 connection pooling.
// Set ds.setMaxPoolSize(-1) for turning OFF connection pooling
ds.setMaxPoolSize( "10000" ) ;
ds.setMinPoolSize( "1000" ) ;

// Properties relevant for Type 4 statement pooling.
// Set ds.setMaxStatement(0) for turning statement pooling OFF
// Statement pooling is enabled only when connection pooling is
// enabled.
ds.setMaxStatements( "7000" ) ;
----

This technique essentially builds a properties file. For more information,
see <<creating-and-using-a-properties-file, Creating and Using a Properties File>>.

[[programmatically-registering-the-datasource-object]]
=== Programmatically Registering the DataSource Object

In the following example, the code shows how to register, programmatically,
the `HPT4DataSource` object `ds` that was created using the preceding code with JNDI.

[source, java]
----
java.util.Hashtable env = new java.util.Hashtable() ;
env.put( Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "Factory class name here" ) ;

javax.naming.Context ctx = new javax.naming.InitialContext( env ) ;
ctx.rebind( "myDataSource", ds ) ;
----

[[retrieving-a-datasource-instance-by-using-jndi-and-connecting-to-the-data-source]]
=== Retrieving a DataSource Instance by Using JNDI and Connecting to the Data Source
Typically, the JDBC application looks up the data source JNDI name from a
context object. Once the application has the `DataSource` object, then the application
does a `getConnection()` call on the data source and gets a connection.

The steps that JDBC application does to connect to and use the data source associated
with the database are listed below together with the application code to perform the
operation.

1. Import the packages.
+
[source, java]
----
import javax.naming.* ;
import java.sql.* ;
import javax.sql.DataSource ;
----

2. Create the initial context.
+
[source, java]
----
Hashtable env = new Hashtable() ;
env.put( Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory" ) ;
try
{
   Context ctx = new InitialContext( env ) ; 
}
catch( ... )
{
...
}
----
+
<<<
3. Look up the JNDI name associated with the data source `myDataSource`, where `myDataSource`
is the logical name that will be associated with the real-world data source - server.
+
[source, java]
----
DataSource ds = (DataSource)ctx.lookup( "myDataSource" ) ;
----

4. Create the connection using the data source.
+
[source, java]
----
con = ds.getConnection() ;
----

5. Do work with the connection. The following statements are just a simple example.
+
[source, java]
----
stmt = con.createStatement() ;
try
{
   stmt.executeUpdate( "drop table tdata" ) ;
}
catch ( SQLException e ) {}
----

[[specifying-the-properties-file-that-configures-the-data-source]]
=== Specifying the Properties File that Configures the Data Source

To use the properties file method to configure a `DataSource` object, the properties
file must exist on disk and contain the `property_name=property_value` pairs that
configure the data source.
See <<creating-and-using-a-properties-file, Creating and Using a Properties File>>
for more information about creating this file.

When the JDBC application makes the connection, then the application should
pass the properties file as a command-line parameter:

```
java -Dhpt4jdbc.properties=<path of properties file on disk>
```

[[connection-by-using-the-drivermanager-class]]
== Connection by Using the DriverManager Class

The `java.sql.DriverManager` class is widely used to get a connection, but
is less portable than the `DataSource` class. The `DriverManager` class
works with the Driver interface to manage the set of drivers loaded.
When an application issues a request for a connection using the
`DriverManager.getConnection` method and provides a URL, the `DriverManager`
finds a suitable driver that recognizes this URL and obtains a database
connection using that driver.

`org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4Driver` is the Type 4 driver class that
implements the `java.sql.Driver` interface.

<<<
[[loading-and-registering-the-driver]]
=== Loading and Registering the Driver

Before connecting to the database, the application loads the Driver
class and registers the Type 4 driver with the DriverManager class in
one of the following ways:

* Specifies the Type 4 driver class in the `-Djdbc.drivers` option in the
command line of the Java program:
+
```
-Djdbc.drivers=org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4Driver
```

* Uses the `Class.forName` method programmatically within the application:
+
[source, java]
----
Class.forName("org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4Driver")
----

* Adds the Type 4 driver class to the `java.lang.System` property
`jdbc.drivers` property within the application:
+
```
jdbc.drivers=org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4Driver
```

<<<
[[establishing-the-connection]]
=== Establishing the Connection

The `DriverManager.getConnection` method accepts a string containing a
Type 4 driver URL. The JDBC URL for the Type 4 driver is

```
jdbc:t4jdbc://<ip addr or host name>:23400/[:][property=value[;property2=value2]...]
```

[cols="40%,60%", options="header"]
|===
| Parameter                | Usage
| `<ip addr or host name>` | The primary IP address or host name for the {project-name} database.
| `23400`                  | The port number for the {project-name} SQL database.
| `property = value` and `property2=value2` | Specifies a Type 4 driver property name-property value pair. The pairs must be separated by a
semicolon (`;`). For example, `T4LogLevel=ALL;T4LogFile=temp1.log`.
|===

For information about the properties file, see  <<type-4-driver-properties,Type 4 Driver Properties>>.

To establish a connection, the JDBC application can use this code:

[source, java]
----
Class.forName( "org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4Driver" ) ; //loads the driver

String url = "jdbc:hpt4jdbc://<database primary IP address>:23400/"

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection( url, "userID", "Passwd" ) ;
----

The variable con represents a connection to the data source that can be
used to create and execute SQL statements.

[[guidelines-for-connections-using-the-driver-manager]]
=== Guidelines for Connections Using the Driver Manager

* The Type 4 driver defines a set of properties that you can use to
configure the driver. For detailed information about these properties,
see  <<type-4-driver-properties,Type 4 Driver Properties>>.
* Java applications can specify the properties in these ways (listed in
the order of precedence):
+
1.  Using the `java.util.Properties` parameter in the `getConnection` method of DriverManager class.

2.  Using the database URL in the `DriverManager.getconnection` method, where the URL is:
+
```
jdbc:t4jdbc://<ip addr or host name>:23400/:property=value
```
+
`<ip addr or host name>` is the primary IP address or host name for the {project-name} database.
+
<<<
3.  Using a properties file for the JDBC driver. The properties file is
passed as a command-line parameter. The format to enter the properties
file in the command line is:
+
```
-Dt4jdbc.properties=<path of properties file on disk>
```
+
For example, `-Dt4jdbc.properties=C:\temp\t4props`
+
For information about the properties file, see <<creating-and-using-a-properties-file, Creating and Using a Properties File>>.
4.  Using JDBC properties with the `-D` option in the command line. If
used, this option applies to all JDBC connections using the
`DriverManager` within the Java application. The format in the command
line is:
+
```
-Dt4jdbc.property_name=<property value>
```
+
For example, `-Dt4jdbc.maxStatements=1024`

<<<
[[connection-pooling]]
== Connection Pooling

The Type 4 driver provides an implementation of connection pooling,
where a cache of physical database connections are assigned to a client
session and reused for the database activity. If connection pooling is
active, connections are not physically closed. The connection is
returned to its connection pool when the `Connection.close()` method is
called. The next time a connection is requested by the client, the
driver will return the pooled connection, and not a new physical
connection.

* The connection pooling feature is available when the JDBC application
uses either the `DriverManager` class or `DataSource` interface to obtain a
JDBC connection. The connection pool size is determined by the
`maxPoolSize` property value and `minPoolSize` property value.

* By default, connection pooling is disabled. To enable connection
pooling, set the maxPoolSize property to an integer value greater than 0
(zero).

* Manage connection pooling by using these Type 4 driver properties:

** `maxPoolSize` under <<maxpoolsize-property, maxpoolsize Property>>
** `minPoolSize` under <<minpoolsize-property, minPoolSize Property>>
** `initialPoolSize` under <<initialpoolsize-property, initialPoolSize Property>>
** `maxStatements` under <<maxstatements-property, maxStatements Property>>

* When used with the DriverManager class, the Type 4 driver has a
connection-pool manager that determines which connections are pooled
together by a unique value for these combination of properties:
+
```
url
catalog
schema
username
password
```
+
Therefore, connections that have the same values for the combination of
a set of properties are pooled together.
+
NOTE: The connection-pooling property values used at the first
connection of a given combination are effective throughout the life of
the process. An application cannot change any of these property values
after the first connection for a given combination.

<<<
[[statement-pooling]]
== Statement Pooling

The statement pooling feature allows applications to reuse the
PreparedStatement object in the same way that they can reuse a
connection in the connection pooling environment. Statement pooling is
completely transparent to the application.

[[guidelines-for-statement-pooling]]
=== Guidelines for Statement Pooling

* To enable statement pooling, set the `maxStatements` property to an
integer value greater than 0 and enable connection pooling. For more
information, see <<initialpoolsize-property, initialPoolSize Property>> and
<<connection-pooling, Connection Pooling>>.

* Enabling statement pooling for your JDBC applications might
dramatically improve the performance.

* Explicitly close a prepared statement by using the `Statement.close`
method because `PreparedStatement` objects that are not in scope are also
not reused unless the application explicitly closes them.

* To ensure that your application reuses a `PreparedStatement`, call
either of these methods:

** `Statement.close method`: called by the application.
** `Connection.close method`: called by the application. All the
`PreparedStatement` objects that were in use are ready to be reused when
the connection is reused.

[[troubleshooting-statement-pooling]]
=== Troubleshooting Statement Pooling

Note the following Type 4 driver implementation details if you are
troubleshooting statement pooling:

* The Type 4 driver looks for a matching `PreparedStatement` object in the
statement pool and reuses the `PreparedStatement`. The matching criteria
include the SQL string, catalog, current schema, current transaction
isolation, and result set holdability.
+
If the Type 4 driver finds the matching `PreparedStatement` object, then the
driver returns the same `PreparedStatement` object to the application for reuse
and marks the `PreparedStatement` object as in use.

* The algorithm, _earlier used are the first to go_, is used to make
room for caching subsequently generated `PreparedStatement` objects when
the number of statements reaches the `maxStatements` limit.

* The Type 4 driver assumes that any SQL CONTROL statements in effect at
the time of execution or reuse are the same as those in effect at the time
of SQL compilation.
+
If this condition is not true, then reuse of a `PreparedStatement` object might
result in unexpected behavior.

* Avoid recompiling to yield performance improvements from statement
pooling. The SQL executor automatically recompiles queries when certain conditions are met.
Some of these conditions are:

** A run-time version of a table has a different redefinition timestamp
than the compile-time version of the same table.

** An existing open operation on a table was eliminated by a DDL or SQL
utility operation.

** The transaction isolation level and access mode at execution time is
different from that at the compile time.

* When a query is recompiled, then the SQL executor stores the recompiled query;
therefore, the query is recompiled only once until any of the previous conditions
are met again.

* The Type 4 driver does not cache `Statement` objects.

[[thread-safe-database-access]]
== Thread-Safe Database Access

In the Type 4 driver, API layer classes are implemented as
instance-specific objects to ensure thread safety:

* `HPT4DataSource.getConnection()` is implemented as a synchronized method
to ensure thread safety in getting a connection.

* Once a connection is made, the `Connection` object is instance-specific.

* If multiple statements are run on different threads in a single
connection, then statement objects are serialized to prevent data corruption.

[[update-where-current-of-operations]]
== "Update  .  .  .  Where Current of" Operations

The fetch size on a `ResultSet` must be 1 when performing an
`update . . . where current of` _cursor_ SQL statement.

If the value of the fetch size is greater than 1, the result of the
`update . . . where current` of operation might be one of the following:

* An incorrect row might be updated based on the actual cursor position.

* An SQLException might occur because the cursor being updated might
have already been closed.

The following is an example of setting a result set's fetch size to 1
and executing an `update . . . where current` of _cursor_ SQL statement.

[source, java]
----
ResultSet rs ;
  ...

  rs.setFetchSize( 1 ) ;
  String st1 = rs.getCursorName() ;

  Statement stmt2 =
    connection.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY
                              , ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE
                              ) ;
  stmt2.executeUpdate( "UPDATE cat2.sch2.table1
                        SET j = 'update row' WHERE CURRENT OF "
                     + st1
                     ) ;
----

[[infostats-command-for-obtaining-query-costs]]
== INFOSTATS Command for Obtaining Query Costs

The INFOSTATS command reports the roll-up costs of a particular query.
INFOSTATS is a pass-through command that collects statistics for a
prepared statement. Statistics are returned to the JDBC application as a
result set as soon as the prepare is finished. The result set has these
columns:

[cols="30%,70%",options="header" ]
|===
| Column                     | Description
| `Query ID (SQL_CHAR)`      | The unique identifier for the query.
| `CPUTime (SQL_DOUBLE)`     | An estimate of the number of seconds of processor time it might take to execute the instructions for this query. A value of 1.0 is 1 second.
| `IOTime (SQL_DOUBLE)`      | An estimate of the number of seconds of I/O time (seeks plus data transfer) to perform the I/O for this query.
| `MsgTime (SQL_DOUBLE)`     | An estimate of the number of seconds it takes for the messaging for this query. The estimate includes the time for the number of local and remote
messages and the amount of data sent.
| `IdleTime (SQL_DOUBLE)`    | An estimate of the maximum number of seconds to wait for an event to happen for this query. The estimate includes the amount of time to open
a table or start an ESP process.
| `TotalTime (SQL_DOUBLE)`   | Estimated cost associated to execute the query.
| `Cardinality (SQL_DOUBLE)` | Estimated number of rows that will be returned.
|===

<<<
[[use-of-the-infostats-command]]
=== Use of the INFOSTATS Command

The INFOSTATS command can only be used with PreparedStatement objects.
The syntax is:

```
INFOSTATS cursor_name
```

where `cursor_name` is the name of the prepared statement. If the cursor name is case-sensitive,
then enclose it in single quotes.

To get the cursor name, use the `getStatementLabel()` method that is
defined for the {project-name} JDBC Type 4 driver with class:

[source, java]
----
org.trafodion.jdbc.t4.T4PreparedStatement: public String
getStatementLabel() ;
----

*Considerations*

* You can use INFOSTATS in these methods only:
+
[source, java]
----
java.sql.Statement.executeQuery(String sql)
java.sql.Statement.execute(String sql)
----

* `setCursorName` is not supported with INFOSTATS.

* If you invoke INFOSTATS incorrectly, the Type 4 driver issues this error:
+
```
Message: INFOSTATS command can only be executed
         by calling execute(String sql) method.
         Sqlstate HY000

[[internationalization-support]]
== Internationalization Support

[[when-string-literals-are-used-in-applications]]
=== When String Literals Are Used in Applications

Internationalization support in the driver affects the handling of
string literals. The Type 4 driver handles string literals in two
situations.

1. When the driver processes an SQL statement. For example,
+
[source, java]
----
Statement stmt = connection.getStatement() ;

stmt.execute( "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 = 'abcd'" ) ;
----

2. When the driver processes JDBC parameters. For example,
+
[source, java]
----
PreparedStatement pStmt = connection.prepareStatement(
   "SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 = ?" ) ;
pStmt.setString( 1, "abcd" ) ;
----

To convert a string literal from the Java to an array of bytes for
processing by the {project-name}, the Type 4 driver uses
the column type in the database.

[[controlling-string-literal-conversion-by-using-the-character-set-properties]]
=== Controlling String Literal Conversion by Using the Character-Set Properties

The Type 4 driver provides character-set mapping properties. These
properties allow you to explicitly define the translation of internal
SQL character-set formats to and from the Java string Unicode (`UnicodeBigUnmarked`)
encoding.

The Type 4 driver provides character-set mapping properties through key
values as shown in the following table.

[cols="50%,50%",options="header" ]
|===
| Key        | Default Value
| `ISO88591` | `ISO88591_1`
| `KANJI`    | `SJIS`

A description of these character sets appears in table below, which
summarizes the character sets supported by {project-name}.

[cols="25%,35%,40%",options="header" ]
|===
| {project-name} Character Set | Corresponding Java Encoding Set^1^ | Description
| ISO88591                     | ISO88591_1 | Single-character, 8-bit character-data type ISO88591 supports English and other Western European languages.
|===

^1^ Canonical Name for `java.io` and `java.lang` API.

For detailed information, see <<iso88591-property, ISO88591 Property>>.

[[using-the-character-set-properties]]
==== Using the Character-Set Properties

The `java.sql.PreparedStatement` class contains the methods `setString()`
and `setCharacterStream()`. These methods take a String and Reader
parameter, respectively.

The `java.sql.ResultSet` class contains the methods `getString()` and
`getCharacterStream()`. These methods return a String and Reader, respectively.

[[retrieving-a-column]]
===== Retrieving a Column

When you retrieve a column as a string (for example, call the
`getString()` or `getCharacterStream` methods), the Type 4 driver uses the
character-set mapping property key to instantiate a String object (where
that key corresponds to the character set of the column).

*Example*

The following `SQL CREATE TABLE` statement creates a table that has an
`ISO88591` column.

[source, sql]
----
CREATE TABLE t1 ( c1 CHAR(20) CHARACTER SET ISO88591 ) ;
----

The JDBC program uses the following java command to set the ISO88591
property and issues the `getString()` method.

[source, java]
----
java -Dhpt4jdbc.ISO88591=SJIS test1.java

// The following method invocation returns a String object, which
// was created using the "SJIS" Java canonical name as the charset
// parameter to the String constructor.
String s1 = rs.getString( 1 ) ; // get column 1 as a String
----

[[setting-a-parameter]]
===== Setting a Parameter

When you set a parameter by using a String (for example, call the
`setString()` method), the Type 4 driver uses the key's value when
generating the internal representation of the String (where that
key corresponds to the character set of the column). The
character-set parameter to the String `getBytes` method is the Java
Canonical name that corresponds to the column's character set.

*Example*

The following `SQL CREATE TABLE` statement creates a table
that has an ISO88591 column:

```
CREATE TABLE t1 ( c1 CHAR(20) CHARACTER SET ISO88591) ;
> java -DISO88591=SJIS test1.java
```

The following method invocation sets column one of `stmt` to the String
"abcd" where "abcd" is encoded as SJIS. The charset parameter to the
String `getBytes` method is SJIS `stmt.setString( 1, "abcd" ) ;`.

[[controlling-what-happens-on-an-exception]]
==== Controlling What Happens on an Exception

You can use the `translationVerification` property to explicitly define
the behavior of the driver if the driver cannot translate all or part of
an SQL parameter. The value portion of the property can be `TRUE` or
`FALSE`. (The default value is `FALSE`).

If the `translationVerification` property's value is `FALSE` and the driver
cannot translate all or part of an SQL statement, then the translation is
unspecified. In most cases, the characters that are untranslatable are
encoded as ISO88591 single-byte question marks (`'?'` or `0x3F`). No
exception or warning is thrown.

If the `translationVerification` property's value is TRUE and the driver
cannot translate all or part of an SQL statement, then the driver throws an
`SQLException` with the following text:

```
Translation of parameter to {0} failed. Cause: {1}
```

where `{0}` is replaced with the target character set and `{1}` is
replaced with the cause of the translation failure.

<<translationverification-property, translationVerification Property>>.

=== Localizing Error Messages and Status Messages

The Type 4 driver supports Internationalization through resource bundles
for localized error messages and status messages. The driver uses a set
of static strings from a property file to map error messages and status
messages to their textual representation.

[[file-name-format-for-the-localized-messages-file]]
==== File-Name Format for the Localized-Messages File

The property file that has the messages must have a file name in the
form:

```
T4Messages_xx.properties
```

where `xx` is the locale name. The locale name is defined by the current
default locale or by the language property.

The Type 4 driver is shipped with an error messages and status messages
property file that contains the textual representation of errors and
status messages for the English locale. The file is named
`T4Messages_en.properties`.

[[localized-message-string-format]]
==== Localized-Message String Format

A localized message file contains strings in the form:

```
message=message_text
```

*Example*

```
driver_err_error_from_server_msg=An error was returned from the server.
Error: {0} Error detail: {1}
```

where the `message` is `driver_err_error_from_server_msg`. The
`message_text` is: `An error was returned from the server. Error: {0} Error detail: {1}`

The pattern `{n}` in `message_text`, where `n` equals 1, 2, 3, and
so forth, is a placeholder that is filled in at run time by the Type 4
driver. Any translation must include these placeholders.

[[procedure-to-create-a-localized-message-file]]
==== Procedure to Create a Localized-Message File

1.  Extract the `T4Messages_en.properties file`, which is in the
`jdbcT4-*.jar file`.
+
*Example*
+
From a UNIX prompt, use the jar Java tool: `jar -x T4Messages_en.properties < jdbcT4-*.jar`

2.  Copy the file.

3.  Edit the file and replace the English text with the text for your locale.

4.  Save the file, giving it a file name that meets the naming
requirements described under
<<file-name-format-for-the-localized-messages-file, File-Name Format for the Localized-Messages File>>.

5.  Put the file in a directory anywhere in the class path for running the JDBC application.

The new messages file can be anywhere in the class path for running the
user application.

At run time, if driver cannot read the messages property file, the
driver uses the `message` portion of the property as the text of the
message. For a description of the message portion, see the
<<localized-message-string-format, Localized-Message String Format>>.
