[[type-4-driver-property-descriptions]]
= Type 4 Driver Property Descriptions

The properties are listed in alphabetic order with their descriptions.
For the properties summarized in categories, see
<<summary-of-type-4-driver-properties, Summary of Type 4 Driver Properties>>.

////
[[blobtablename]]
== blobTableName Property

See <<lob-table-name, LOB Table Name Properties>>.
////

[[catalog]]
== catalog Property

The `catalog` property sets the default catalog used to access SQL objects
referenced in SQL statements if the SQL objects are not fully qualified.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object. For information about how to set
properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: none
```

*Example*

Specifying the catalog TRAFODION:

```
catalog=TRAFODION
```

////
[[clobtablename]]
== clobTableName Property

See <<lob-table-name, LOB Table Name Properties>>.
////

<<<
[[connectiontimeout]]
== connectionTimeout Property

The `connectionTimeout` property sets the number of seconds a connection
can be idle before the connection is physically closed by DCS.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object. For information about how to set
properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: int

Units: seconds

Default: -1 (Use the ConnTimeout value set on the server-side data source.)

Range: -1, 0 to 2147483647
```

* Zero (0) specifies infinity as the timeout value.
* A non-zero positive value overrides the value set on the
{project-name}  data source, if allowed by the connectivity settings.
* A negative value is treated as -1.

*Example*

Consider the following scenario.

Even if a connection is not being used, it takes up resources. The application
abandons connections; that is, the application does not physically close a
connection after the application finishes using the connection.

However, you can configure the connection to close itself after 300 seconds by setting
the `connectionTimeout` property. Then, when a connection is not referenced for 300 seconds,
the connection automatically closes itself.

In this example, the specification to set the `connectionTimeout` property is:

```
connectionTimeout=300
```

<<<
[[fetchbuffersize]]
== fetchBufferSize Property

The `fetchBufferSize` property provides the benefits of bulk fetch.

This property sets the value in kilobytes (KB) of the size of the fetch
buffer that is used when rows are fetched from a `ResultSet` object after
a successful `executeQuery()` operation on a statement.

Set this property on a `DriverManager` object. For information about how to set
properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: short

Default size: 4

Range: 4 through 32767
```

* Zero and negative values are treated as default values.
* The Type 4 driver guarantees that the number of rows internally
fetched will be no less than the minimum of the row size (set using
the `setFetchSize` method) and the number of rows that will fit in the
memory specified by the `setFetchSize` (set using the property).

*Example*

```
fetchBufferSize=32
```

<<<
[[initialpoolsize]]
== initialPoolSize Property

The `initialPoolSize` property sets the initial connection pool size when
connection pooling is used with the Type 4 driver.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object. For information about how to set
properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

The driver creates _n_ connections (where _n_ is `initialPoolSize`) for
each connection pool when the first connection is requested. For
example, if `initialPoolSize` is set to `5` for a data source, then the driver
attempts to create and pool five connections the first time the
application calls the data source's `getConnection()` method.

```
Data type: int

Units: number of physical connections

Default: -1 (Do not create an initial connection pool.)

Range: -1 to maxPoolSize
```

* Any negative value is treated as -1.
* Values can be less than `minPoolSize`, but must not exceed `maxPoolSize`.
If the specified value is greater than `maxPoolSize`, the `maxPoolSize`
property value is used.

*Example*

```
initialPoolSize=10
```

<<<
[[iso88591]]
== ISO88591 Property

The `ISO88591` character-set mapping property corresponds to the
SQL ISO88591 character set, which is a single-byte
8-bit character set for character data types. This property supports
English and other Western European languages. For more information, see
<<internationalization-support, Internationalization Support>>.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object or `DriverManager` object. This
property is ignored for connections made through the
`ConnectionPoolDataSource` object. 
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.
```
Data type: String

Default: ISO88591_1

The value can be any valid Java Canonical Name as listed in the
"Canonical Name for java.io and java.lang API" column of the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html[Java documentation].

For more information, see
<<internationalization-support, Internationalization Support>>.

<<<
[[kanji]]
== KANJI Property

The `KANJI` character-set mapping property corresponds to the
SQL KANJI character set, which is a double-byte character set widely used on Japanese mainframes.
This property is a subset of Shift JIS: the double character portion. The encoding for
this property is big endian.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: SJIS (which is shift-JIS, Japanese)
```

*Example*

```
java -Dt4jdbc.KANJI=SJIS
```

For more information, see
<<internationalization-support, Internationalization Support>>.

<<<
[[ksc5601]]
== KSC5601 Property

The `KSC5601` character-set mapping property corresponds to the
SQL KSC5601 character set, which is a double-byte
character set.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: ECU_KR (which is KS C 5601, ECU encoding, Korean)
```

The value can be any valid Java Canonical Name as listed in the
"Canonical Name for java.io and java.lang API" column of the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html[Java documentation].

*Example*

```
java -Dt4jdbc.KSC5601=ECU_KR
```

For more information, see
<<internationalization-support, Internationalization Support>>.

<<<
[[language]]
== language Property

The `language` property sets the language used for the error messages. For
more information about using this property, see
<<localizing-error-messages-and-status-messages, Localizing Error Messages and Status Messages>>

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: none
```

The value can be any valid Java Canonical Name as listed in the
"Canonical Name for java.io and java.lang API" column of the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html[Java documentation].

*Example*

To set the language to shift-JIS, Japanese:

```
language=SJIS
```

////
[[lob-table-name]]
== LOB Table Name Properties

LOB tables store data for BLOB columns and CLOB columns. The properties
that specify the LOB table for using BLOB columns or CLOB columns are:

* For the binary data for BLOB columns `blobTableName`.
* For the character data for CLOB columns `clobTableName`.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

The property value is of the form:

```
catalog_name.schema_name.lob_table_name
```

```
Data type: String

Default: none
```

*Example*

```
blobTableName=samdbcat.sales.lobvideo
```
////

<<<
[[logintimeout]]
== loginTimeout Property

The `loginTimeout` property sets the time limit that a connection can be
attempted before the connection disconnects. When a connection is
attempted for a period longer than the set value, in seconds, the
connection disconnects.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: int

Units: seconds

Default: 60

Range: 0 to 2147483647
```

If set to 0 (zero), no login timeout is specified.

<<<
[[maxidletime]]
== maxIdleTime Property

The `maxIdleTime` property determines the number of seconds that a
physical connection should remain unused in the pool before the
connection is closed. 0 (zero) indicates no limit.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: int

Units: seconds

Default: 0 (No timeout)

Range: 0 through 2147483647
```

Any negative value is treated as 0, which indicates that no time limit
applies.

*Example*

To set the maximum idle time to 5 minutes (300 seconds):

```
java -Dhpt4jdbc.maxIdleTime=300
```

<<<
[[maxpoolsize]]
== maxPoolSize Property

The `maxPoolSize` property sets the maximum number of physical connections
that the pool can contain. These connections include both free
connections and connections in use. When the maximum number of physical
connections is reached, the Type 4 driver throws an SQLException and
sends the message, Maximum pool size is reached.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: int

Units: number of physical connections

Default: -1 (Disables connection pooling.)

Range: -1, 0 through 2147483647, but greater than minPoolSize
```

The value determines connection-pool use as follows:

* Any negative value is treated like -1.

* 0 means no maximum pool size.

* A value of -1 disables connection pooling.

Any positive value less than `minPoolSize` is changed to the `minPoolSize` value.

<<<
[[maxstatements]]
== maxStatements Property

The `maxStatements` property sets the total number of `PreparedStatement`
objects that the connection pool should cache. This total includes both
free objects and objects in use.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: int

Units: number of objects

Default: 0 (Disables statement pooling.)

Range: 0 through 2147483647
```

The value 0 disables statement pooling. Any negative value is treated
like 0 (zero).

TIP: To improve performance, we recommend that you enable statement pooling for
your JDBC applications because this pooling can dramatically help the
performance of many applications.

NOTE: Statement pooling can be in effect only if connection pooling is
enabled.

*Example*

To specify statement pooling, type:

```
maxStatements=10
```

<<<
[[minpoolsize]]
== minPoolSize Property

The `minPoolSize` property limits the number of physical connections that
can be in the free connection pool.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: int

Default: -1 (The minPoolSize value is ignored.)

Range: -1, 0 through n, but less than maxPoolSize
```

* Any negative value is treated like -1.

* Any value greater than `maxPoolSize` is changed to the `maxPoolSize` value.

* The value of `minPoolSize` is set to -1 when `maxPoolSize` is -1. The value determines
connection pool use as follows:

** When the number of physical connections in the free pool reaches the
`minPoolSize` value, the Type 4 driver closes subsequent connections by
physically closing them and not adding them to the free pool.

** 0 (zero) means that the connections are not physically closed; the
connections are always added to the free pool when the connection is
closed.

*Example*

Use the following specification to set the `minPoolSize`
value to 1, which ensures that one connection is always retained:

```
minPoolSize=1
```

<<<
[[networktimeout]]
== networkTimeout Property

The `networkTimeout` property sets a time limit that the driver waits for
a reply from the database server. When an operation is attempted for a
period longer than the set value, in seconds, the driver stops waiting
for a reply and returns an SQLException to the user application.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

CAUTION: Be careful when using this property. A network timeout causes
the socket connection between the Type 4 driver and the connectivity
server to timeout. If the server is engaged in a transaction or an SQL
operation, then the server continues to perform that transaction or
operation until the transaction or operation fails, the transaction
manager times out, or the server realizes that the Type 4 driver client
has gone away. A network timeout can result in an open transaction or
operation that continues for a significant time before failing or
rolling back. As a result of a network timeout, the connection becomes
unavailable.

```
Data type: int

Units: seconds

Default: 0 (No network timeout is specified.)

0 through to 2147483647
```

<<<
[[password]]
== password Property

The `password` property sets the password value for passing to the DCS
server. By using this property, you can also change the password. The
password is encrypted when it is passed to the server.

The format for specifying the password is:

```
password=old [, new, new ]
```

* `old` is the current password

* `new` is the new password. Passwords must be 6 to 8 characters long and
cannot contain double quotes (").

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: empty string
```

*Example*

```
password=eye0weU$
```

[[properties]]
== properties Property

The `properties` property specifies the location of the properties file
that contains keyword-value pairs that specify property values for
configuring the Type 4 driver. For more information, see
<<creating-and-using-a-properties-file, Creating and Using a Properties File>>.

<<<
[[reservedatalocators]]
== reserveDataLocators Property

The `reserveDataLocators` property sets the number of data locators to be
reserved for a process that stores data in a LOB table.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: int

Units: number of data locators to be reserved

Default: 100

Range: 1 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (2**63 -1)
```

Do not set a value much greater than the number of data locators
actually needed. If the specified value is 0 (zero) or less, the default
value (100) is used.

Base the setting of the value of the `reserveDataLocators` property on the
application profile being executed. If the application inserts a large
number of LOB items, then a higher value of the `reserveDataLocators` property
can prevent frequent updating of the `ZZ_DATA_LOCATOR` value in the LOB
table. However, if the application inserts only a small number of LOB
items, then a smaller value is better. If a large value is used, then holes
(unused data-locator numbers) could occur in the LOB table. These holes
represent unused space.

Also, the administrator should avoid setting high values for the
`reserveDataLocators` (for example, in the range of trillions or so).
Setting high values prevents other Type 4 applications that use LOB
table from reserving data locators.

For additional information about data locator use, see
<<reserving-data-locators, Reserving Data Locators>>.

To change this value for a JDBC application, specify this property from
the command line.

*Example*

The following command reserves 150 data
locators for program class `myProgramClass`.

```
java -Dhpt4jdbc.reserveDataLocators=150 myProgramClass
```

<<<
[[roundingmode]]
== roundingMode Property

The `roundingMode` property specifies the rounding behavior of the Type 4
driver. For example, if the data is 1234.127 and column definition is
`NUMERIC(6, 2)` and the application does `setDouble()` and `getDouble()`,
then the value returned is 1234.12, which is truncated as specified by the
default rounding mode, `ROUND_DOWN`.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: ROUND_DOWN
```

Values for roundingMode are:

```
ROUND_CEILING

ROUND_DOWN

ROUND_FLOOR

ROUND_HALF_DOWN

ROUND_HALF_EVEN

ROUND_HALF_UP

ROUND_UNNECESSARY

ROUND_UP
```

* For the definition of rounding mode values, see the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html[java.math.BigDecimal] documentation.

* If the application sets erroneous values for the `roundingMode` property, no error is thrown by the Type 4 driver.
The driver uses `ROUND_DOWN` value instead.

* To have the application get the `DataTruncation` exception when data is
truncated, set the `roundingMode` property to `ROUND_UNNECESSARY`.

<<<
[[schema]]
== schema Property

The `schema` property sets the database schema that accesses SQL objects
referenced in SQL statements if the SQL objects are not fully qualified.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: none
```

*Example*

```
schema=sales
```

<<<
[[t4logfile]]
== T4LogFile Property

The `T4LogFile` property sets the name of the logging file for the Type 4 driver.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String
```

Default file name is defined by the following pattern:

```
%h/t4jdbc%u.log
```

where

* `/` represents the local pathname separator.

* `%h` represents the value of the user.home system property. _%u_
represents a unique number to resolve conflicts.

Any valid file name for your system is allowed.

If you explicitly specify a log file, then that file is overwritten each time
a `FileHandler` is established using that file name.

To retain previously created log files, use the standard
`java.util.logging `file syntax to append a unique number onto each log
file.

*Example*

You can have the following property in a data source:

```
T4LogFile = C:/temp/MyLogFile%u.log
```

That name causes the Type 4 driver to create a new log file using a
unique name for each connection made through that data source.

<<<
*Example*

```
C:/temp/MyLogFile43289.log

C:/temp/MyLogFile87634.log

C:/temp/MyLogFile27794.log
```

If you explicitly specify a log file that is not fully qualified, the
Type 4 driver creates the file in the current working directory, for
example, in the directory from which the JVM was invoked.

For detailed information about java.util.logging, see the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html[logging summary] documentation. 

<<<
[[t4loglevel]]
== T4LogLevel Property

The `T4LogLevel` property sets the logging levels that control logging
output for the Type 4 driver. The Java package java.util.logging logs
error messages and traces messages in the driver.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: OFF
```

*Logging Levels*
[cols="20%,80%",options="header" ]
|===
| Level     | Description
| `OFF`     | A special level that turns off logging; the default setting.
| `SEVERE`  | Indicates a serious failure; usually applies to SQL exceptions generated by the Type 4 driver.
| `WARNING` | Indicates a potential problem, which usually applies to SQL warnings generated by the Type 4 driver.
| `INFO`    | Provides informational messages, typically about connection pooling, statement pooling, and resource usage. This information can
help in tuning application performance.
| `CONFIG`  | Provides static configuration messages that can include property values and other Type 4 driver configuration information.
| `FINE`    | Provides tracing information from the Type 4 driver methods described in the Type 4 driver API. The level of tracing is equivalent
to the level of tracing provided when calling the `setLogWriter()` method of the `DriverManager` class or the DataSource class.
| `FINER`   | Indicates a detailed tracing message for which internal Type 4 driver methods provide messages. These messages can be useful in debugging the Type 4 driver.
| `FINEST`  | Indicates a highly detailed tracing message. The driver provides detailed internal data messages that can be useful in debugging the Type 4 driver.
| `ALL`     |Logs all messages.
|===

*Example*

To enable tracing, use the `hpt4jdbc.T4LogLevel` property specified in the command line:

```
-Dt4jdbc.T4LogLevel=FINE
```

<<<
[[t4loglevel-considerations]]
=== T4LogLevel Considerations

* If a security manager is defined by your application using an AppServer,
then `LoggingPermission` must be must be granted in the `java.policy` file as
follows:
+
```
permission java.util.logging.LoggingPermission "control", "" ;
```

* The Type 4 driver is not designed to inherit the `java.util.logging.FileHandler.level` settings at program startup.

<<<
[[translationverification]]
== translationVerification Property

The `translationVerification` property defines the behavior of the driver
if the driver cannot translate all or part of an SQL statement or SQL
parameter.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

The value can be TRUE or FALSE.

```
Data type: String

Default: FALSE
```


[cols="10%,45%,45%", options="header"]
|===
| Value   | Scenario | What Happens
| `FALSE` | The driver is unable to translate all or part of an SQL statement, then the translation is unspecified. |
In most cases, the characters that are untranslatable are encoded as ISO88591 single-byte question marks (`?` or `0x3F`). No
exception or warning is thrown.
| `TRUE`  | The driver cannot translation all or part of an SQL statement or parameter. | The driver throws an SQLException with this text. +
 +
`Translation of parameter to {0} failed. Cause: {1}` +
 +
where `{0}` is replaced with the target character set and `{1}` is
replaced with the cause of the translation failure.
|===

NOTE: If the `translationVerification` property is set to TRUE, then the process can
use significantly more system resources. For better performance, set this property to FALSE.

For more information, see <<internationalization-support, Internationalization Support>>.

<<<
[[url]]
== url Property

The `url` property sets the URL value for the database.
This property is used in the `DriverManager` object. The format
to specify the URL is:

```
jdbc:t4jdbc//<primary IP addr or hostname of database>:23400/[:]
[ property=value [ ; property2=value ] ... ]
```

where `<primary IP_addr or hostname of database>:23400>` specifies the location of the database.

```
Data type: String

Default: none
```

*Example*

```
url=jdbc:t4jdbc://mynode.mycompanynetwork.net:23400/
```

[[url-property-considerations]]
=== url Property Considerations

* If the url parameter is not specified and `DriverManager.getConnection()` is called, then the Type 4 driver throws an SQLException.

* If you use a literal IPV4 or IPV6 address in a URL, note these guidelines:

** *For IPV6 only*: enclose the address in brackets (`[` and `]`).

** The port number is optional according to both the IPV4 and IPV6 standard.

** The default port number for the database is `23400`.

<<<
[[user]]
== user Property

The `user` property sets the role value for the connectivity service. The
role name passed must have adequate access permissions for SQL data
accessed through the connectivity service.

Set this property on a `DataSource` object, `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
object, or `DriverManager` object.
For information about how to set properties, see
<<how-to-specify-jdbc-type-4-properties, How to Specify JDBC Type 4 Properties>>.

```
Data type: String

Default: empty string

```

*Example*
