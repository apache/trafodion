= Prepare
You need to prepare your Hadoop environment before installing {project-name}.

[[prepare-install-optional-workstation-software]]
== Install Optional Workstation Software

If you are using a Windows workstation, then the following optional software helps installation process.
We recommended that you pre-install the software before continuing with the {project-name} installation:

* putty and puttygen (download from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html[PuTTY web site])
* VNC client (download from http://www.realvnc.com[RealVNC web site])
* Firefox or Chrome browser
* SFTP client to transfer files from your workstation to the Linux server: WinSCP or FileZilla

[[configure-installation-user-id]]
== Configure Installation User ID

If using the command-line Installer,
{project-name} installation requires a user ID with these attributes:

* `sudo` access per the requirements documented in <<requirements-linux-installation-user,Linux Installation User>>.
* passwordless ssh to all nodes on the cluster where {project-name} will be installed.

NOTE: You may need to request permission from your cluster-management team to obtain this type of access.

The following example shows how to set up your user ID to have "passwordless ssh" abilities.

Do the following on the Provision Master Node:

```
echo -e 'y\n' | ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
echo localhost $(cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub) >> $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts
echo "NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes" >> $HOME/.ssh/config
chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/config
chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 $HOME/.ssh/
```

After running these commands, do the following:

* If necessary, create the `$HOME/.ssh` directory on the other nodes in your cluster and secure it private to yourself (`chmod 700`).
* If necessary, create the `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the other nodes in your cluster. Secure it with `chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
* Copy the content of the `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file on the Provisioning Master Node and append the to the
`$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the other nodes in your cluster.
* `ssh` to the other nodes in the cluster. Answer `y` to the prompt asking you whether to continue the connection.
This adds the node to the `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` file completing the passwordless ssh setup.


[[prepare-disable-requiretty]]
== Disable requiretty
If using the command-line Installer,
you need to disable `requiretty` in `/etc/sudoers` on all nodes in the cluster
to ensure that `sudo` commands can be run from inside the installation scripts.

Comment out the `Defaults requiretty` setting in the `/etc/sudoers` file to
ensure that the `requiretty` option is NOT being used.

[[prepare-verify-os-requirements-and-recommendations]]
== Verify OS Requirements and Recommendations

Please ensure that the <<requirements-os-requirements-and-recommendations,OS Requirements and Recommendations>>
are met for each node in the cluster where you intend to install {project-name}.

<<<
[[prepare-configure-kerberos]]
== Configure Kerberos

If your Hadoop installation has enabled Kerberos, then {project-name} needs to have Kerberos enabled.  If not,
then {project-name} will not run. If you plan to enable Kerberos in {project-name}, then you need to have access to a KDC (Kerberos Key Distribution
Center) and administration credentials so you can create the necessary {project-name} principals and keytabs.

If you wish to manually set up and activate Kerberos principals and keytabs, then refer to the section on
<<enable-security-kerberos,Kerberos>>.

[[prepare-configure-ldap-identity-store]]
== Configure LDAP Identity Store

If you plan to enable security features in {project-name}, then you need to have an LDAP identity store available to perform authentication.
The {project-name} Installer prompts you to set up an authentication configuration file that points to an LDAP server (or servers),
which enables security (that is, authentication and authorization) in the {project-name} database.

If you wish to manually set up the authentication configuration file and enable security, then refer to the section on
<<enable-security-ldap,LDAP>>.

[[prepare-gather-configuration-information]]
== Gather Configuration Information

You need to gather/decide information about your environment to aid installation {project-name} for the {project-name} Installer. (Listed in alphabetical order to make it easier to find information when referenced in the install and upgrade instructions.)

* Can't download the required software packages using the Internet.

If none of these situations exist, then we highly recommend that you use the {project-name} Installer.

You perform this step as a user with `root` or `sudo` access.

Install the packages listed in <<requirements-software-packages,Software Packages>> above on all nodes in the cluster.

<<<
[[prepare-download-trafodion-binaries]]
== Download {project-name} Binaries

You download the {project-name} binaries from the {project-name} {download-url}[Download] page.
Download the following packages:

Command-line Installation

* {project-name} Installer
* {project-name} Server tar file

Ambari Installation

* {project-name} Ambari RPM
* {project-name} Server RPM

NOTE: You can download and install the {project-name} Clients once you've installed and activated {project-name}. Refer to the
{docs-url}/client_install/index.html[{project-name} Client Install Guide] for instructions.
