== Manage {project-name}

You use the {project-name} runtime user ID to perform {project-name} management operations.

The following table provides an overview of the different {project-name} management scripts.

[cols="40%,20%l,20%l,20%l",options="header"]
|===
| Component                              | Start     | Stop     | Status
| *All of {project-name}*                | sqstart   | sqstop   | sqcheck
| *RMS Server*                           | rmsstart  | rmsstop  | rmscheck
| *REST Server*                          | reststart | reststop | -
| *LOB Server*                           | lobstart  | lobstop  | -
| *DCS (Database Connectivity Services)* | dcsstart  | dcsstop  | dcscheck
|===

*Example: Start {project-name}*

```
cd $MY_SQROOT/sql/scripts
sqstart
sqcheck
```

[[activate-validate-trafodion-installation]]
== Validate {project-name} Installation

You can use sqlci (part of the base product) or trafci (requires separate install; see the
{docs-url}/client_install/index.html[{project-name} Client Installation Guide]) to validate your installation.

=== Smoke Test
A simple smoke test to validate that {project-name} is functioning.

```
get schemas;
create table table1 (a int);
invoke table1;
insert into table1 values (1), (2), (3), (4);
select * from table1;
drop table table1;
exit;
```

Assuming no errors, your installation has been successful. Next, do the following:

* Install the {project-name} client software. Refer to the {docs-url}/client_install/index.html[{project-name} Client Installation Guide].
* Use {project-name}. Refer to the {docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual.]
* Review other {project-name} documentation. Refer to the http://trafodion.apache.org/documentation.html[{project-name} documentation].

[[activate-troubleshooting-tips]]
== Troubleshooting Tips

If you are not able to start up the environment or if there are problems running sqlci or trafci, then verify that the all the processes are up and running.

* `sqcheck` should indicate all processes are running.
 
If processes are not running as expected, then:

* `sqstop` to shut down {project-name}. If some {project-name} processes do not terminate cleanly, then run `ckillall`.
* `sqstart` to restart {project-name}.
 
If problems persist please review logs:

* `$MY_SQROOT/logs`: {project-name} logs.
