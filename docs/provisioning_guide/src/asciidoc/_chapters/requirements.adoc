[[requirements]]
= Requirements

{project-name} requires an x86 version of Linux. 

The current release of {project-name} has been tested with:

* 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7
* SUSE SLES 11.3
* Cloudera CDH 5.2
* Cloudera CDH 5.3
* Hortonworks HDP 2.2

Other OS releases may work, too. The {project-name} project is currently working on better support for non-distribution version of Hadoop.

[[requirements-general-cluster-and-os-requirements-and-recommendations]]
== General Cluster and OS Requirements and Recommendations

64-bit x86 instruction set running a Linux distribution is required. Further, {project-name} assumes an environment 
based on the requirements of the tested Hadoop distributions/services. 

[[requirements-cluster-requirements-and-recommendations]]
=== Hardware Requirements and Recommendations

[[requirements-single-node-cluster]]
==== Single-Node Cluster
It is possible to run {project-name} on a single-node sandbox environment. Typically, any sandbox running a Hadoop distribution 
can be used. A typical single-node configuration uses 4-8 cores with 16 GB of memory, and  20 GB free disk space.

[[requirements-multi-node-cluster]]
==== Multi-Node Cluster 
For multi-node end-user clusters, your typical HBase environment should suffice for {project-name}.
Typically, memory configuration range between 64-128 GB per node with minimum requirement of 16 GB. 
The cluster size can span from 1 to _n_ nodes; a minimum of two nodes is recommended. 
A minimum of two cores is required regardless of whether you're deploying {project-name} on a bare-metal or virtual environment.

|===

There are two port ranges used by {project-name}.

* 23400 is a range, to allow multiple mxosrvr processes on each node. Allow a range of a few ports,
enough to cover all the servers per node that are listed in the "servers" file in the DCS configuration directory.
* 24410 is a range as well, enough to cover the DCS servers per node, usually 1 or 2.

On top of the ports identified above, you also need the ports required by your Hadoop distribution. For example:

* http://www.cloudera.com/content/www/en-us/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cdh_ig_ports_cdh5.html[_Cloudera Ports_]
* http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.3.0-Win/bk_HDP_Install_Win/content/ref-79239257-778e-42a9-9059-d982d0c08885.1.html[_Hortonworks Ports_]

Although not all the ports will be used on every node of the cluster, you need to open most of them for all the nodes in the cluster that
have {project-name}, HBase, or HDFS servers on them.

[[requirements-prerequisite-software]]
== Prerequisite Software

[[requirements-hadoop-software]]
=== Hadoop Software

{project-name} runs as an add-on service on Hadoop distributions. The following Hadoop services and their dependencies must be installed and running 
on the cluster where you intend to install {project-name}:

* Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
* YARN with MapReduce version 2
* ZooKeeper
* HBase
* Hive
* Apache Ambari (Hortonworks) or Cloudera Manager (Cloudera) with associated embedded databases.

The following distributions have been tested with {project-name}.^1^

[cols="25%,15%,10%,50%",options="header"]

|===

1. Future releases of {project-name} will move away from distribution-specific integration. Instead, {project-name} will be tested with
specific version of the Hadoop, HDFS, HBase, and other services/products only.
2. When possible, install using *parcels* to simply the installation process.

NOTE: {project-name} does not yet support installation on a non-distribution version of Hadoop; that is,
Hadoop downloaded from the Apache web site. This restriction will be lifted in a later release of
{project-name}.

[[requirements-software-packages]]
=== Software Packages

In addition to the software packages required to run different Hadoop services listed above (for example, `Java`), 
{project-name} requires supplementary software to be installed on the cluster before it is installed. These are Linux
tools that are not typically packaged as part of the core Linux distribution.

NOTE: For RedHat/CentOS, the {project-name} Installer automatically attempts get a subset of these packages over the Internet.
If the cluster's access to the Internet is disabled, then you need to manually download the packages and make them available
for installation. You need to build and install `log4c&#43;&#43;` manually.

1. `log4c&#43;&#43;` was recently withdrawn from public repositories. Therefore, you will need to build the `log4c&#43;&#43;` RPM
on your system and then install the RPM using the procedure described in <<log4cplusplus_installation,log4c++ Installation>>.
2. Software package required to build `log4c&#43;&#43;`. Not required otherwise. These packages are *not* installed by the {project-name} Installer in this release.

The {project-name} Installer requires Internet access to install the required software packages.

[[requirements-trafodion-user-ids-and-their-privileges]]
== {project-name} User IDs and Their Privileges

[[requirements-trafodion-runtime-user]]
=== {project-name} Runtime User

The `trafodion:trafodion` user ID is created as part of the installation process. The default password is: `traf123`.

{project-name} requires that either HDFS ACL support or Kerberos is enabled. The {project-name} Installer will enable HDFS ACL support.
Kerberos-based security settings are outside the scope of this guide. Please refer to the security information in
https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#security[Apache HBase(TM) Reference Guide] for information about how to set up
HBase security with Kerberos.

Also, {project-name} requires `sudo` access to `ip` and `arping` so that floating or elastic IP addresses can be moved from one node to
another in case of node failures.

NOTE: Do *not* create the `trafodion:trafodion` user ID in advance. The {project-name} Installer uses the presence of this user ID to determine
whether you're doing an installation or upgrade.

[[requirements-trafodion-provisioning-user]]
=== {project-name} Provisioning User

Typically, the {project-name} Installer is used for {project-name} installations. It requires access to the user IDs documented below.

[[requirements-linux-installation-user]]
==== Linux Installation User
The user ID that performs the {project-name} installation steps. Typically, this User ID runs the {project-name} Installer.

*Requirements*:

* User name or group cannot be `trafodion`.
* Passwordless ssh access to all nodes in the cluster.
* Internet access to download software packages.
* `requiretty` must be disabled in `/etc/sudoers`.
* `sudo`^1^ access to:
** Download and install software packages.
** Modify `/etc/sudoers.d` (allow the `trafodion` user to modify floating IP: `ip` and `arping`).
** Create the `trafodion` user ID and group.
** Install {project-name} software into the HBase environment.
** Run Java version command on each node in the cluster.
** Run Hadoop version command on each node in the cluster.
** Run HBase version command on each node in the cluster.
** Create directories and files in:
*** `/etc`
*** `/usr/lib`
*** `/var/log`
** Invoke `su` to execute commands as other users; for example, `trafodion`.
** Edit `sysctl.conf` and activate changes using `sysctl -p`:
*** Modify kernel limits.
*** Reserve IP ports.

^1^ `sudo` is *required* in the current release of {project-name}. This restriction may be relaxed in later releases.
Alternative mechanisms for privileged access (such as running as `root` or `sudo` alternative commands) are not supported.

[[requirements-distribution-manager-user]]
==== Distribution Manager User
A user ID that can change the configuration using Apache Ambari or Cloudera Manager. The {project-name} Installer makes REST
request to perform configuration and control functions to the distribution manager using this user ID.

*Requirements*:

* Administrator user name and password.
* URL to Distribution Manager's REST API.

[[requirements-hdfs-administrator-user]]
==== HDFS Administrator User
The HDFS super user. Required to create directories and change security settings, as needed.
The {project-name} Installer uses `su` to run commands under this user ID.

*Requirements*:

* HDFS Administrator user name.
* Write access to home directory on the node where the Distribution Manager is running.

[[requirements-hbase-administrator-user]]
==== HBase Administrator User
The HBase super user. Required to change directory ownership in HDFS.

*Requirements*:

* HBase Administrator user name and group.
* Read access to `hbase-site.xml`.

[[requirements-required-configuration-changes]]
== Required Configuration Changes

{project-name} requires changes to a number of different areas of your system configuration: operating system, HDFS, and HBase.

NOTE: These changes are performed by the {project-name} Installer, if used.

[[requirements-operating-system-changes]]

| Setting | New Value | Purpose
| hbase.master.
distributed.log.splitting | false | Do not use the HBase Split Log Manager. Instead, the HMaster controls all log-splitting activities.
| hbase.coprocessor.
region.classes | 
org.apache.hadoop.
hbase.coprocessor.
transactional.TrxRegionObserver,
org.apache.hadoop.
hbase.coprocessor.
transactional.TrxRegionEndpoint,
org.apache.hadoop.
hbase.coprocessor.
AggregateImplementation | Install {project-name} coprocessor classes.
| hbase.hregion.impl | org.apache.hadoop.
hbase.regionserver.
transactional.TransactionalRegion | {project-name} needs to be able to read the Write Ahead Log from a coprocessor using the getScanner method. This method
is protected in standard HBase. This change overloads the getScanner method to be public thereby allowing coprocessor code to use it.
| hbase.regionserver.
region.split.policy | org.apache.hadoop.
hbase.regionserver.
ConstantSizeRegionSplitPolicy | Tell HBase to use the ConstantSizeRegionSplitPolicy for region splitting. 
This setting causes region splitting to occur only when the maximum file size is reached. 
| hbase.snapshot.
enabled | true | Enable the HBase Snapshot feature. Used for {project-name} backup and restore.
| hbase.bulkload.
staging.dir | hbase-staging | Use `/hbase-staging` as the bulk load staging directory.
| hbase.regionserver.region.
transactional.tlog | true | The HBase Regions requests that the Transaction Manager re-drives in-doubt transactions.
| hbase.snapshot.
master.timeoutMillis | 600000 | HMaster timeout when waiting for RegionServers involved in the snapshot operation.
| hbase.snapshot.
region.timeout | 600000 | RegionServer timeout when waiting for snapshot to be created.
| hbase.client.
scanner.timeout.period | 600000 | Time limit to perform a scan request. 
| hbase.regionserver.
lease.period | 600000 | Clients must report within this time limit or they are considered dead by HBase.
| hbase.namenode.
java.heapsize^1^ | 1073741824 (1GB) | Java Heap Size for the HDFS NameNode.
| hbase.secondary.namenode.
java.heapsize^1^ | 1073741824 (1GB) | Java Heap Size for the HDFS Secondary NameNode.

[[requirements-recommended-configuration-changes]]
== Recommended Configuration Changes
The following configuration changes are recommended but not required.

NOTE: The {project-name} Installer does *not* make these changes.

[[requirements-recommended-security-changes]]
=== Recommended Security Changes

The `trafodion` user ID should not be given other `sudo` privileges than what's specified in this manual. Also, we
recommend that this user ID is locked (`sudo passwd -l trafodion`) once the installation/upgrade activity has been completed.
Users that need issue commands as the `trafodion` ID should do so using `sudo`; for example, `sudo -u trafodion -i`.


[[requirements-recommended-hdfs-configuration-changes]]
=== Recommended HDFS Configuration Changes

These settings are configured in the `hadoop-env.sh` file.

| DataNode Java Heap Size           | 2 GB                | Use this setting for a large configuration.
| NameNode Java Heap Size           | 2 GB                | Use this setting for a large configuration.
| Secondary NameNode Java Heap Size | 2 GB                | Use this setting for a large configuration.

[cols="30%l,20%,50%a",options="header"]
|===
| Configuration Property | Recommended Setting | Guidance
| hbase.rpc.timeout | 10 minutes | This setting depends on the tables' size. Sixty (60) seconds is the default. 
Increase this value for big tables. Make it the same value as `hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period`. We have found 
that increasing the setting to six-hundred (600) seconds will prevent many of the timeout-related errors we encountered, 
such as `OutOfOrderNextException` errors.
| hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period | 10 minutes | Similar to the `hbase.rpc.timeout` setting. Sixty (60) seconds is the 
default. Depending on the size of a user table, we have experienced timeout failures on count(*) and update statistics commands 
from this setting. The underlying issue is the length of the execution of the coprocessor within HBase.
 +
NOTE: HBase uses the smaller of `hbase.rpc.timeout` and `hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period` to calculate the scanner timeout. 
| hbase.snapshot.master.timeoutMillis and hbase.snapshot.region.timeout | 10 minutes | HBase's default setting is 60000 milliseconds. 
If you experience timeout issues with HBase snapshots when you use the {project-name} Bulk Loader or other statements, 
you can set the value for these two HBase properties to 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds).
| hbase.hregion.max.filesize | 107374182400 bytes | HBase's default setting is 10737418240 (10 GB). We have increased the setting to 
107374182400 (100 GB), which reduces the number of HStoreFiles per table and appears to reduce disruptions to active transactions from 
region splitting.
| hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles | 10 | http://gbif.blogspot.com/2012/07/optimizing-writes-in-hbase.html
| hbase.regionserver.handler.count | <num> | This setting should match the number of concurrent sessions (mxosrvr). The default is 10.
