[[introduction]]
= Introduction

{project-name} is a Hadoop add-on service that provides transactional SQL on top of HBase. Typically, you
use {project-name} as the database for applications that require Online Transaction Processing (OLTP),
Operational Data Store (ODS), and/or strong reporting capabilities. You access {project-name} using
standard JDBC and ODBC APIs.

You may choose whether to add {project-name} to an existing Hadoop environment or to create a standalone
Hadoop environment specifically for Hadoop.

This guide assumes that a Hadoop environment exists upon which your provisioning {project-name}. Refer to
<<requirements-hadoop-software,Hadoop Software>> for information about what Hadoop software is required
{project-name}.

[[introduction-security-considerations]]
== Security Considerations

The following users and principals need be considered for {project-name}:

* *Provisioning User*: A Linux-level user that performs the {project-name} provisioning tasks. This user ID
requires `sudo` access and passwordless ssh among the nodes where {project-name} is installed. In addition,
this user ID requires access to Hadoop distribution, HDFS, and HBase administrative users to change
respective environment's configuration settings per {project-name} requirements. Refer to
<<requirements-trafodion-provisioning-user,{project-name} Provisioning User>> for more information
about the requirements and usage associated with this user ID.

* *Runtime User*: A Linux-level user under which the {project-name} software runs. This user ID must be registered
as a user in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to store and  access objects in HDFS, HBase, and Hive.
In addition, this  user ID requires passwordless access among the nodes where {project-name} is installed.
Refer to <<requirements-trafodion-runtime-user,{project-name} Runtime User>> for more information about this user ID.

* *{project-name} Database Users*: {project-name} users are managed by {project-name} security features (grant, revoke, etc.),
which can be integrated with LDAP if so desired. These users are referred to as *database users* and
do not have direct access to the operating system. Refer to <<enable-security-ldap,LDAP>> for 
details on enabling LDAP for authenticating database users. 
Refer to {docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#register_user_statement[Register User],
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#grant_statement[Grant], and other SQL statements
in the {docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual] for
more information about managing {project-name} Database Users.
 +
 +
If your environment has been provisioned with Kerberos, then the following additional information is required. 

* *KDC admin principal*: {project-name} requires administrator access to Kerberos to create principals 
and keytabs for the `trafodion` user, and to look-up principal names for HDFS and HBase keytabs.  Refer to 
<<enable-security-kerberos,Kerberos>> for more information about the requirements and usage associated with this principal.

* *HBase keytab location*: {project-name} requires administrator access to HBase to grant required privileges to the `trafodion` user.  Refer to
<<enable-security-kerberos,Kerberos>> for more information about the requirements and usage associated with this keytab.

* *HDFS keytab location*: {project-name} requires administrator access to HDFS to create directories that store files needed to perform SQL requests 
such as data loads and backups.  Refer to
<<enable-security-kerberos,Kerberos>> for more information about the requirements and usage associated with this keytab.
 +
 +
If your environment is using LDAP for authentication, then the following additional information is required.

* *LDAP username for database root access*:  When {project-name} is installed, it creates a predefined database user referred to as the DB\__ROOT user.  
In order to connect to the database as database root, there must be a mapping between the database user DB__ROOT and an LDAP user. Refer to  
<<enable-security-ldap,LDAP>> for more information about this option.

* *LDAP search user name*: {project-name} optionally requests an LDAP username and password in order to perform LDAP operations 
such as LDAP search.  Refer to
<<enable-security-ldap,LDAP>> for more information about this option.

[[introduction-provisioning-options]]
== Provisioning Options

{project-name} ships with a set of scripts that takes care of many of the installation and upgrade
tasks associated with the {project-name} software and its requirements. The main features include:

* *{project-name} installer*: Performs installation and upgrade for {project-name}
* *{project-name} uninstaller*: Uninstalls {project-name}
* *{project-name} security installer*: Enables security features including Kerberos and LDAP for an existing {project-name} installation

Currently, the {project-name} Installer is able to install {project-name} on select Cloudera and  Hortonworks Hadoop distributions, and for select vanilla Hadoop installations.
The {project-name} Installer limitations are noted as they apply in the different chapters below. For example, the {project-name} Installer
is less capable on SUSE than it is on RedHat/CentOS; you have to install the prerequisite software packages outside the {project-name} Installer.

The {project-name} Installer automates many of the tasks required to install/upgrade {project-name}, spanning from downloading and
installing required software packages and making required changes to your Hadoop environment via creating
the {project-name} runtime user ID to installing and starting {project-name}. It is, therefore,  highly recommend that
you use the {project-name} Installer for initial installation and upgrades of {project-name}. These steps are referred to as
"Script-Based Provisioning" in this guide. Refer to <<introduction-trafodion-installer, {project-name} Installer>> that provides
usage information.

If, for any reason, you choose not to use the {project-name} Installer, then separate chapters provide
step-by-step recipes for the tasks required to install/upgrade {project-name}. These steps are referred to as
*Recipe-Based Provisioning* in this guide. It is assumed that you are well-versed in Linux and Hadoop
administrative tasks if using Recipe-Based Provisioning.

[[introduction-provisioning-activities]]
== Provisioning Activities

{project-name} provisioning is divided into the following main activities:

* *<<requirements,Requirements>>*: Activities and documentation required to install the {project-name} software.
These activities include tasks such as understanding hardware and operating system requirements,
Hadoop requirements, what software packages that need to be downloaded, configuration settings that need to be changed,
and user ID requirements.

* *<<prepare,Prepare>>*: Activities to prepare the operating system and the Hadoop ecosystem to run
{project-name}. These activities include tasks such as installing required software packages, configure
the {project-name} Installation User, gather information about the Hadoop environment, and the modify configuration
for different Hadoop services.

* *<<install,Install>>*: Activities related to installing the {project-name} software. These activities
include tasks such as unpacking the {project-name} tar files, creating the {project-name} Runtime User,
creating {project-name} HDFS directories, installing the {project-name} software, and enabling security features.

* *<<upgrade,Upgrade>>*: Activities related to the upgrading the {project-name} software. These activities
include tasks such as shutting down {project-name} and installing a new version of the {project-name} software.
The upgrade tasks vary depending on the differences between the current and new release of
{project-name}. For example, an upgrade may or may not include an upgrade of the {project-name} metadata.

* *<<activate,Activate>>*: Activities related to starting the {project-name} software. These actives
include basic management tasks such as starting and checking the status of the {project-name} components and performing basic smoke tests.

* *<<remove,Remove>>*: Activities related to removing {project-name} from your Hadoop cluster.

* *<<enable-security,Enable Security>>*: Activities related to enabling security features on an already installed
{project-name} installation.  These activities include tasks such as adding Kerberos principals and keytabs,
and setting up the LDAP configuration files.

[[introduction-provisioning-master-node]]
== Provisioning Master Node
All provisioning tasks are performed from a single node in the cluster, which must be part
of the Hadoop environment you're adding {project-name} to. This node is referred to as the
"*Provisioning Master Node*" in this guide.

The {project-name} Provisioning User must have access to all other nodes from the Provisioning
Master Node in order to perform provisioning tasks on the cluster.

[[introduction-trafodion-installer]]
== {project-name} Installer

The {project-name} Installer is a set of scripts automates most of the tasks requires to install/upgrade {project-name}.
You download the {project-name} Installer tar file from the {project-name} {download-url}[download] page.
Next, you unpack the tar file.

*Example*

```
$ mkdir $HOME/trafodion-installer
$ cd $HOME/trafodion-downloads
$ tar -zxf apache-trafodion-installer-1.3.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz -C $HOME/trafodion-installer
$ 
```

<<<
The {project-name} Installer supports two different modes:

1. *Guided Setup*: Prompts for information as it works through the installation/upgrade process. This mode is recommended for new users.
2. *Automated Setup*: Required information is provided in a pre-formatted bash-script configuration file, which is provided
via a command argument when running the {project-name} Installer thereby suppressing all prompts. There is one exception, 
if Kerberos is enabled on the cluster, then you will always be prompted for the KDC admin password.  We do not store the 
KDC admin password as part of installation anywhere.
+
A template of the configuration file is available here within the installer directory: `trafodion_config_default`.
Make a copy of the file in your directory and populate the needed information.
+
Automated Setup is recommended since it allows you to record the required provisioning information ahead of time.
Refer to <<introduction-trafodion-automated-setup,Automated Setup>> for information about how to
populate this file.

[[introduction-trafodion-installer-usage]]
=== Usage

The following shows help for the {project-name} Installer.

```
./trafodion_install --help

This script will install Trafodion. It will create a configuration
file (if one has not been created), setup of the environment needed
for Trafodion, configure HBase with Hbase-trx and co-processors needed,
and install a specified Trafodion build.

Options:
    --help             Print this message and exit
    --accept_license   If provided, the user agrees to accept all the
                       provisions in the Trafodion license.  This allows
                       for automation by skipping the display and prompt of
                       the Trafodion license.
    --config_file      If provided, all install prompts will be
                       taken from this file and not prompted for.
```

<<<
[[introduction-trafodion-installer-install-vs-upgrade]]
=== Install vs. Upgrade

The {project-name} Installer automatically detects whether you're performing an install
or an upgrade by looking for the {project-name} Runtime User in the `/etc/passwd` file.

* If the user ID doesn't exist, then the {project-name} Installer runs in install mode.
* If the user ID exists, then the {project-name} Installer runs in upgrade mode.


[[introduction-trafodion-installer-guided-setup]]
=== Guided Setup

By default, the {project-name} Installer runs in Guided Setup mode, which means
that it prompts you for information during the install/upgrade process.

Refer to the following sections for examples:

* <<install-guided-install, Guided Install>>
* <<upgrade-guided-upgrade, Guided Upgrade>>

[[introduction-trafodion-installer-automated-setup]]
=== Automated Setup

The `--config_file` option runs the {project-name} in Automated Setup mode.

Before running the {project-name} Installer with this option, you do the following:

1. Copy the `trafodion_config_default` file.
+
*Example*
+
```
cp trafodion_config_default my_config
```

2. Edit the new file using information you collect in the
<<prepare-gather-configuration-information,Gather Configuration Information>>
section in the <<prepare,Prepare>> chapter.

3. Run the {project-name} Installer in Automated Setup Mode
+
*Example*
+
```
./trafodion_installer --config_file my_config
```

NOTE: Your {project-name} Configuration File contains the password for the {project-name} Runtime User
and for the Distribution Manager. Therefore, we recommend that you secure the file in a manner
that matches the security policies of your organization. 

NOTE: If you are installing {project-name} on a version of Hadoop that has been instrumented with Kerberos,
you will be asked for a password associated with a Kerberos administrator.  

==== Example: Creating a {project-name} Configuration File

Using the instructions in <<prepare-gather-configuration-information,Gather Configuration Information>>
in the <<prepare,Prepare>> chapter, you record the following information.
