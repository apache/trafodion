[[install-ambari]]
= Install with Ambari

This method of installation uses RPM packages rather than tar files. There are two packages:

* traf_ambari - Ambari management pack (plug-in) that is installed on the Ambari Server node
* apache-trafodion_server - {project-name} package that is installed on every data node

You can either set up a local yum repository (requires a web server) or install the RPMs
manually on each node.

== Local Repository

On your web server host, be sure the *createrepo* package is installed.
Copy the two RPM files into a directory served to the web and run the createrepo command.

 $ createrepo -d .

The command must be used to update repo meta-data any time new RPMs are added or replaced.

Note the {project-name} repository URL for later use.

== Install Ambari Management Pack for {project-name}

On your Ambari server host:

. If Ambari Server is not already installed, be sure to download a yum repo file for Ambari.
For example: http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.4.2.0/bk_ambari-installation/content/download_the_ambari_repo_lnx6.html[Ambari-2.4.2 repo].

. Add a yum repo file with the URL of your local repository, or copy the traf_ambari RPM locally.

. Install the {project-name} Ambari management pack RPM. Ambari server will be installed as a dependency, if not already installed.

 $ sudo yum install traf_ambari

. Set-up Ambari
.. If Ambari server was previously running, restart it.

 $ sudo ambari-server restart

.. If Ambari server was not previously running, initialize and start it.

 $ sudo ambari-server setup
 ...
 $ sudo ambari-server start

== Install {project-name}

Unlike the command-line installer, {project-name} can be provisioned at time of creating a new cluster.

=== Initial Cluster Creation

If you are creating a new cluster and you have the {project-name} server RPM hosted on a local yum repository, then
create the cluster as normal, and select a stack version that includs the {project-name} service.

When selecting HDP stack version, Ambari prompts for the repository URLs, be *sure to update the {project-name} URL
to the URL for your local repository*.

If you plan to install the server RPM manually, set the {project-name} URL to some other valid repository, otherwise the
the invalid URL will cause errors later.
Any valid repo URL will do. You may copy the HDP URL and paste it into the {project-name} URL.
In this case, do not select the {project-name} service on the "Choose Services" step. First, create a cluster
without the {project-name} service and follow instructions below for an existing cluster.

=== Existing Cluster

If you are not using a local yum repository, manually copy the apache-trafodion_server RPM to each data node and
install it using yum install.

Using Ambari, select the cluster and then from the Actions menu choose "Add Service" and select {project-name}.

WARNING: You may get a configuration warning regarding a hbase-site setting. In this case, follow the warning message
instructions to go back to the HBase advanced configuration, hbase-site section and use the button to revert to
the recommended value for "hbase.coprocessor.region.classes".

Several services will need to be restarted before the {project-name} service can be started.
Choose cluster "Actions" menu option "Restart All Required".

== Initialize Meta-Data

After {project-name} is installed and started, it must be initialized before use. Select the {project-name} service
and then from the Service Actions menu choose "Initialize" and confirm the action.

image:{images}/amb5.PNG[width=300,height=250,alt="Initialize"]

== Upgrade from Prior Version

First, be sure to stop the trafodion service prior to upgrading.

Upgrade the traf_ambari package and re-start ambari-server service.

 $ sudo ambari-server restart

==== Upgrade Entire HDP Stack

Ambari requires version upgrades to be an entire stack, not single components. If you want to
include a trafodion upgrade in entire stack version upgrade, first upgrade the traf_ambari
package and restart Ambari server.

Once that is done, proceed with the upgrade following Ambari instructions. Be sure to
define the Trafodion-2.2 URL that points to a repo server with the new apache-trafodion_server
package.

==== Upgrade Only Trafodion

In this case, Ambari will not upgrade a single component, so the apache-trafodion_server
package must be installed on each node directly (via yum command). Once that is done, the
service can be started as usual.
