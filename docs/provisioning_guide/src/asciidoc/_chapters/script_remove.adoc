You use the {project-name} Provisioning User for these instructions.	

NOTE: You do not need to use the `trafodion_uninstaller` script if upgrading {project-name}. Instead, use the `trafodion_install` script,
which automatically upgrades the version of {project-name}. Please refer to the <<install,Install>> chapter for further instructions.

Run the commands from the first node of the cluster. Do not run them from a machine that is not part of the {project-name} cluster.

```
su trafodion
cd $MY_SQROOT/sql/scripts or cds
sqstop
exit
```

*Example*
