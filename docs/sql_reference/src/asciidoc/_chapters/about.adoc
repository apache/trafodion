[[About_This_Document]]
= About This Document
This manual describes reference information about the syntax of SQL statements, functions, and other
SQL language elements supported by the {project-name} projectâ€™s database software.

{project-name} SQL statements and utilities are entered interactively or from script files using a client-based tool,
such as the Trafodion Command Interface (TrafCI). To install and configure a client application that enables you
to connect to and use a {project-name} database, see the
{docs-url}/client_install/index.html[_{project-name} Client Installation Guide_].

NOTE: In this manual, SQL language elements, statements, and clauses within statements are based on the
ANSI SQL:1999 standard.

[[Intended_Audience]]
== Intended Audience
This manual is intended for database administrators and application programmers who are using SQL to read, update,
and create {project-name} SQL tables, which map to HBase tables, and to access native HBase and Hive tables.

You should be familiar with structured query language (SQL) and with the American National Standard Database Language SQL:1999.

<<<
== Notation Conventions
This list summarizes the notation conventions for syntax presentation in this manual.

* UPPERCASE LETTERS
+
Uppercase letters indicate keywords and reserved words. Type these items exactly as shown. Items not enclosed in brackets are required. 
+
```
SELECT
```

* lowercase letters
+
Lowercase letters, regardless of font, indicate variable items that you supply. Items not enclosed in brackets are required.
+
```
file-name
```

* &#91; &#93; Brackets 
+
Brackets enclose optional syntax items.
+
```
DATETIME [start-field TO] end-field
```
+
A group of items enclosed in brackets is a list from which you can choose one item or none.
+
The items in the list can be arranged either vertically, with aligned brackets on each side of the list, or horizontally, enclosed in a pair of brackets and separated by vertical lines.
+
For example: 
+
```
DROP SCHEMA schema [CASCADE]
DROP SCHEMA schema [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

<<<
* { } Braces 
+
Braces enclose required syntax items.
+
```
FROM { grantee [, grantee ] ... }
```
+ 
A group of items enclosed in braces is a list from which you are required to choose one item.
+
The items in the list can be arranged either vertically, with aligned braces on each side of the list, or horizontally, enclosed in a pair of braces and separated by vertical lines.
+
For example:
+
```
INTERVAL { start-field TO end-field }
{ single-field } 
INTERVAL { start-field TO end-field | single-field }
``` 
* | Vertical Line 
+
A vertical line separates alternatives in a horizontal list that is enclosed in brackets or braces.
+
```
{expression | NULL} 
```
* &#8230; Ellipsis
+
An ellipsis immediately following a pair of brackets or braces indicates that you can repeat the enclosed sequence of syntax items any number of times.
+
```
ATTRIBUTE[S] attribute [, attribute] ...
{, sql-expression } ...
```
+ 
An ellipsis immediately following a single syntax item indicates that you can repeat that syntax item any number of times.
+
For example:
+
```
expression-n ...
```

<<<
* Punctuation
+
Parentheses, commas, semicolons, and other symbols not previously described must be typed as shown.
+
```
DAY (datetime-expression)
@script-file 
```
+
Quotation marks around a symbol such as a bracket or brace indicate the symbol is a required character that you must type as shown.
+
For example:
+
```
"{" module-name [, module-name] ... "}"
```

* Item Spacing
+
Spaces shown between items are required unless one of the items is a punctuation symbol such as a parenthesis or a comma.
+
```
DAY (datetime-expression) DAY(datetime-expression)
```
+
If there is no space between two items, spaces are not permitted. In this example, no spaces are permitted between the period and any other items:
+
```
myfile.sh
```

* Line Spacing
+
If the syntax of a command is too long to fit on a single line, each continuation line is indented three spaces and is separated from the preceding line by a blank line.
+
This spacing distinguishes items in a continuation line from items in a vertical list of selections. 
+
```
match-value [NOT] LIKE _pattern
   [ESCAPE esc-char-expression] 
```
