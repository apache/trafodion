[[olap_functions]]
= OLAP Functions

This section describes the syntax and semantics of the On Line
Analytical Process (OLAP) window functions. The OLAP window functions
are ANSI compliant.

[[considerations_for_window_functions]]
== Considerations for Window Functions

These considerations apply to all window functions.

* `_inline-window-specification_`
+
The window defined by the _inline-window-specification_ consists of the
rows specified by the _window-frame-clause_, bounded by the current
partition. If no PARTITION BY clause is specified, the partition is
defined to be all the rows of the intermediate result. If a PARTITION BY
clause is specified, the partition is the set of rows which have the
same values for the expressions specified in the PARTITION clause.

* `_window-frame-clause_`
+
DISTINCT is not supported for window functions.
+
Use of a FOLLOWING term is not supported. Using a FOLLOWING term results
in an error.
+
If no _window-frame-clause_ is specified, "ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED
PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING" is assumed. This clause is not
supported because it involves a FOLLOWING term and will result in an
error.
+
"ROWS CURRENT ROW" is equivalent to "ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND
CURRENT ROW".
+
"ROWS _preceding-row_" is equivalent to "ROWS BETWEEN _preceding-row_
AND CURRENT ROW".

=== Nulls

All nulls are eliminated before the function is applied to the set of
values. If the window contains all NULL values, the result of the window
function is NULL.

If the specified window for a particular row consists of rows that are
all before the first row of the partition (no rows in the window), the
result of the window function is NULL.

[[order_by_clause_supports_expressions_for_olap_functions]]
== ORDER BY Clause Supports Expressions For OLAP Functions

The ORDER BY clause of the OLAP functions now supports expressions.
However, use of multiple OLAP functions with different expressions in
the same query is not supported. The following examples show how
expressions may be used in the ORDER BY clause.

```
SELECT
  -1 * annualsalary neg_total
, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY -1 * annualsalary) olap_rank
FROM employee;
```

Using an aggregate in the ORDER BY clause:

```
SELECT
  num
, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)) olap_rank
FROM employee
GROUP BY num;
```

Using multiple functions with the same expression in the ORDER BY clause:

```
SELECT
  num
, workgroupnum
, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM (annualsalary)*num) olap_rank
, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM (annualsalary)*num) olap_drank
, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM (annualsalary)*num) olap_mum
FROM employee
GROUP BY num, workgroupnum, annualsalary;
```

Using more functions with the same expression in the ORDER BY clause:

```
SELECT
  num
, workgroupnum
, annualsalary
, SUM(AnnualSalary) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)*num ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
, AVG(AnnualSalary) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)*num ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
, MIN(AnnualSalary) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)*num ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
, MAX(AnnualSalary) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)*num ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
, VARIANCE(AnnualSalary) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)*num ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
, STDDEV(AnnualSalary) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)*num ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
, COUNT(AnnualSalary) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(annualsalary)*num ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
FROM employee
GROUP BY num, workgroupnum, annualsalary;
```

<<<
[[limitations_for_window_functions]]
== Limitations for Window Functions

These limitations apply to all window functions.

* The ANSI _window-clause_ is not supported by {project-name}. Only the
_inline-window-specification_ is supported. An attempt to use an ANSI
_window-clause_ will result in a syntax error.

* The _window-frame-clause_ cannot contain a FOLLOWING term, either
explicitly or implicitly. Because the default window frame clause
contains an implicit FOLLOWING ("ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND
UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING"), the default is not supported. So, practically,
the _window-frame-clause_ is not optional. An attempt to use a FOLLOWING
term, either explicitly or implicitly will result in the "4343" error
message.

* The window frame units can only be ROWS. RANGE is not supported by
{project-name}. An attempt to use RANGE will result in a syntax error.

* The ANSI _window-frame-exclusion-specification_ is not supported by
{project-name}. An attempt to use a _window-frame-exclusion-specification_
will result in a syntax error.

* Multiple _inline-window-specifications_ in a single SELECT clause are
not supported. For each window function within a SELECT clause, the
ORDER BY clause and PARTITION BY specifications must be identical. The
window frame can vary within a SELECT clause. An attempt to use multiple
_inline-window-specifications_ in a single SELECT clause will result in
the "4340" error message.

* The ANSI _null-ordering-specification_ within the ORDER BY clause is
not supported by {project-name}. Null values will always be sorted as if they
are greater than all non-null values. This is slightly different than a
null ordering of NULLS LAST. An attempt to use a
_null-ordering-specification_ will result in a syntax error.

* The ANSI _filter-clause_ is not supported for window functions by
{project-name}. The _filter-clause_ applies to all aggregate functions
(grouped and windowed) and that the _filter-clause_ is not currently
supported for grouped aggregate functions. An attempt to use a
_filter-clause_ will result in a syntax error.

* The DISTINCT value for the _set-qualifier-clause_ within a window
function is not supported. Only the ALL value is supported for the
_set-qualifier-clause_ within a window function. An attempt to use
DISTINCT in a window function will result in the "4341" error message.

<<<
* `ALL`
+
specifies whether duplicate values are included in the computation of
the VARIANCE of the _expression_. The default option is ALL, which causes
duplicate values to be included.

* `_expression_`
+
specifies a numeric or interval value expression that determines the
values over which the variance is computed.
See <<expressions,Expressions>>.

* `_inline-window-specification_`
+
specifies the window over which the VARIANCE is computed. The
_inline-window-specification_ can contain an optional PARTITION BY
clause, an optional ORDER BY clause and an optional window frame clause.
The PARTITION BY clause specifies how the intermediate result is
partitioned and the ORDER BY clause specifies how the rows are ordered
within each partition.

* `_window-frame-clause_`
+
specifies the window within the partition over which the VARIANCE is
computed.

* Return the variance of the SALARY column:
+
```
SELECT
  empnum
, VARIANCE (salary) OVER (ORDER BY empnum ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
FROM persnl.employee;
```

* Return the variance of the SALARY column within each department:
+
```
SELECT
  deptnum
, empnum
, VARIANCE (salary) OVER (PARTITION BY deptnum ORDER BY empnum ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)
FROM persnl.employee;
