= SQL Utilities

A utility is a tool that runs within Trafodion SQL and performs tasks.
This section describes the Trafodion SQL utilities:

[cols=","]
|===
| <<load_statement,LOAD Statement>>                           | Uses the Trafodion Bulk Loader to load data from a source table, either

NOTE: Trafodion SQL utilities are entered interactively or from script
files using a client-based tool, such as the Trafodion Command Interface
(TrafCI). To install and configure a client application that enables you
to connect to and issue SQL utilities, see the
http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/client_installation/index.html[_Trafodion Client Installation Guide_].

[[load_statement]]
== LOAD Statement

The LOAD statement uses the Trafodion Bulk Loader to load data from a
source table, either a Trafodion table or a Hive table, into a target
Trafodion table. The Trafodion Bulk Loader prepares and loads HFiles
directly in the region servers and bypasses the write path and the cost
associated with it. The write path begins at a client, moves to a region
server, and ends when data eventually is written to an HBase data file
called an HFile.

The Trafodion bulk load process takes place in two phases:

* _Preparation phase_: In this phase, Trafodion reads the data from
the source files in Hive or HDFS, partitions the data based on the
target table's partitioning scheme, sorts the data, and then generates
KeyValue pairs that will populate the HFiles. Trafodion also encodes the
data for faster storage and retrieval.
* _Loading-the-files-into-HBase phase_: This phase uses the
LoadIncrementalHFiles (also known as the computebulkload tool) and load
the generated HFiles into the region servers.

LOAD is a Trafodion SQL extension.

```
LOAD [WITH option[[,] option]...] INTO target-table SELECT ... FROM source-table

option is:
    TRUNCATE TABLE
  | NO RECOVERY
  | NO POPULATE INDEXES
  | NO DUPLICATE CHECK
  | NO OUTPUT
  | INDEX TABLE ONLY
  | UPSERT USING LOAD
```

[[load_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of LOAD

* `_target-table_`
+
is the name of the target Trafodion table where the data will be loaded.
See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `_source-table_`
+
is the name of either a Trafodion table or a Hive table that has the
source data. Hive tables can be accessed in Trafodion using the
HIVE.HIVE schema (for example, hive.hive.orders). The Hive table needs
to already exist in Hive before Trafodion can access it. If you want to
load data that is already in an HDFS folder, then you need to create an
external Hive table with the right fields and pointing to the HDFS
folder containing the data. You can also specify a WHERE clause on the
source data as a filter.

* `[WITH _option_[[,] _option_]&#8230;]`
+
is a set of options that you can specify for the load operation. You can
specify one or more of these options:

** `TRUNCATE TABLE`
+
causes the Bulk Loader to truncate the target table before starting the
load operation. By default, the Bulk Loader does not truncate the target
table before loading data.

** `NO RECOVERY`
+
specifies that the Bulk Loader not use HBase snapshots for recovery. By
default, the Bulk Loader handles recovery using the HBase snapshots
mechanism.

** `NO POPULATE INDEXES`
+
specifies that the Bulk Loader not handle index maintenance or populate
the indexes. By default, the Bulk Loader handles index maintenance,
disabling indexes before starting the load operation and populating them
after the load operation is complete.

** `NO DUPLICATE CHECK`
+
causes the Bulk Loader to ignore duplicates in the source data. By
default, the Bulk Loader checks if there are duplicates in the source
data and generates an error when it detects duplicates.

** `NO OUTPUT
+
prevents the LOAD statement from displaying status messages. By default,
the LOAD statement prints status messages listing the steps that the
Bulk Loader is executing.

* `INDEX TABLE ONLY`
+
specifies that the target table, which is an index, be populated with
data from the parent table.

* `UPSERT USING LOAD`
+
specifies that the data be inserted into the target table using rowset
inserts without a transaction.

<<<
[[load_considerations]]
=== Considerations for LOAD

[[load_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a LOAD statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the target table.
* You have these privileges:
** SELECT and INSERT privileges on the target table
** DELETE privilege on the target table if TRUNCATE TABLE is specified
* You have the MANAGE_LOAD component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

[[load_configuration_before_running_load]]
==== Configuration Before Running LOAD

Before running the LOAD statement, make sure that you have configured
the staging folder, source table, and HBase according to these
guidelines.

==== Staging Folder for HFiles

The Bulk Loader uses an HDFS folder as a staging area for the HFiles
before calling HBase APIs to merge them into the Trafodion table. By
default, Trafodion uses /bulkload/ as the staging
folder. This folder must be owned by the same user as the one under
which Trafodion runs. Trafodion
also must have full permissions on this folder. The HBase user (that is,
the user under which HBase runs) must have read/write access to this
folder.

Example:

```
drwxr-xr-x - trafodion trafodion 0 2014-07-07 09:49 /bulkload.
```

==== Hive Source Table

To load data stored in HDFS, you will need to create a Hive table with
the right fields and types pointing to the HDFS folder containing the
data before you start the load.

<<<
==== HBase Snapshots

If you do not specify the NO RECOVERY OPTION in the LOAD statement, the
Bulk Loader uses HBase snapshots as a mechanism for recovery. Snapshots
are a lightweight operation where some metadata is copied. (Data is not
copied.) A snapshot is taken before the load starts and is removed after
the load completes successfully. If something goes wrong and it is
possible to recover, the snapshot is used to restore the table to its
initial state before the load started. To use this recovery mechanism,
HBase needs to be configured to allow snapshots.

[[load_examples]]
=== Examples of LOAD

* For customer demographics data residing in
`/hive/tpcds/customer_demographics`, create an external Hive table using
the following Hive SQL:
+
```
create external table customer_demographics
(
    cd_demo_sk int
  , cd_gender string
  , cd_marital_status string
  , cd_education_status string
  , cd_purchase_estimate int
  , cd_credit_rating string
  , cd_dep_count int
  , cd_dep_employed_count int
  , cd_dep_college_count int
)

row format delimited fields terminated by '|' location
'/hive/tpcds/customer_demographics';
```

* The Trafodion table where you want to load the data is defined using
this DDL:
+
```
create table customer_demographics_salt
(
    cd_demo_sk int not null
  , cd_gender char(1)
  , cd_marital_status char(1)
  , cd_education_status char(20)
  , cd_purchase_estimate int
  , cd_credit_rating char(10)
  , cd_dep_count int
  , cd_dep_employed_count int
  , cd_dep_college_count int
  , primary key (cd_demo_sk)
)
salt using 4 partitions on (cd_demo_sk);
```

* This example shows how the LOAD statement loads the
customer_demographics_salt table from the Hive table,
`hive.hive.customer_demographics`:
+
```
>>load into customer_demographics_salt
+>select * from hive.hive.customer_demographics where cd_demo_sk <= 5000;
Task: LOAD Status: Started Object: TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS_SALT
Task: DISABLE INDEX Status: Started Object: TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS_SALT
Task: DISABLE INDEX Status: Ended Object: TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS_SALT
Task: PREPARATION Status: Started Object: TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS_SALT
       Rows Processed: 5000
Task: PREPARATION Status: Ended ET: 00:00:03.199
Task: COMPLETION Status: Started Object: TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS_SALT
Task: COMPLETION Status: Ended ET: 00:00:00.331
Task: POPULATE INDEX Status: Started Object: TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS_SALT
Task: POPULATE INDEX Status: Ended ET: 00:00:05.262
```

<<<
[[populate_index_utility]]
== POPULATE INDEX Utility

The POPULATE INDEX utility performs a fast INSERT of data into an index
from the parent table. You can execute this utility in a client-based
tool like TrafCI.

```
POPULATE INDEX index ON table [index-option]

index-option is:
    ONLINE | OFFLINE
```

[[populate_index_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of POPULATE INDEX

* `_index_`
+
is an SQL identifier that specifies the simple name for the index. You
cannot qualify _index_ with its schema name. Indexes have their own
namespace within a schema, so an index name might be the same as a table
or constraint name. However, no two indexes in a schema can have the
same name.

* `_table_`
+
is the name of the table for which to populate the index. See
<<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `ONLINE`
+
specifies that the populate operation should be done online. That is,
ONLINE allows read and write DML access on the base table while the
populate operation occurs. Additionally, ONLINE reads the audit trail to
replay updates to the base table during the populate phase. If a lot of
audit is generated and you perform many CREATE INDEX operations, we
recommend that you avoid ONLINE operations because they can add more
contention to the audit trail. The default is ONLINE.

* `OFFLINE`
+
specifies that the populate should be done offline. OFFLINE allows only
read DML access to the base table. The base table is unavailable for
write operations at this time. OFFLINE must be specified explicitly.
SELECT is allowed.

<<<
[[populate_index_considerations]]
=== Considerations for POPULATE INDEX

When POPULATE INDEX is executed, the following steps occur:

* The POPULATE INDEX operation runs in many transactions.
* The actual data load operation is run outside of a transaction.

If a failure occurs, the rollback is faster because it does not have to
process a lot of audit. Also, if a failure occurs, the index remains
empty, unaudited, and not attached to the base table (offline).

* When an offline POPULATE INDEX is being executed, the base table is
accessible for read DML operations. When an online POPULATE INDEX is
being executed, the base table is accessible for read and write DML
operations during that time period, except during the commit phase at
the very end.
* If the POPULATE INDEX operation fails unexpectedly, you may need to
drop the index again and re-create and repopulate.
* Online POPULATE INDEX reads the audit trail to replay updates by
allowing read/write access. If you plan to create many indexes in
parallel or if you have a high level of activity on the audit trail, you
should consider using the OFFLINE option.

Errors can occur if the source base table or target index cannot be
accessed, or if the load fails due to some resource problem or problem
in the file system.

[[populate_index_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To perform a POPULATE INDEX operation, one of the following must be
true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the table.
* You have the SELECT and INSERT (or ALL) privileges on the associated table.

[[populate_index_examples]]
=== Examples of POPULATE INDEX

* This example loads the specified index from the specified table:
+
```
POPULATE INDEX myindex ON myschema.mytable;
```

* This example loads the specified index from the specified table, which
uses the default schema:
+
```
POPULATE INDEX index2 ON table2;
```

<<<
[[purgedata_utility]]
== PURGEDATA Utility

The PURGEDATA utility performs a fast DELETE of data from a table and
its related indexes. You can execute this utility in a client-based tool
like TrafCI.

```
PURGEDATA object
```

[[purgedata_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of PURGEDATA

_object_

is the name of the table from which to purge the data. See
<<"database object names","Database Object Names">>.

[[purgedata_considerations]]
=== Considerations for PURGEDATA

* The _object_ can be a table name.
* Errors are returned if _table_ cannot be accessed or if a resource or
file-system problem causes the delete to fail.
* PURGEDATA is not supported for volatile tables.

[[purgedata_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To perform a PURGEDATA operation, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the table.
* You have the SELECT and DELETE (or ALL) privileges on the associated
table.

[[purgedata_availability]]
==== Availability

PURGEDATA marks the table OFFLINE and sets the corrupt bit while
processing. If PURGEDATA fails before it completes, the table and its
dependent indexes will be unavailable, and you must run PURGEDATA again
to complete the operation and remove the data. Error 8551 with an
accompanying file system error 59 or error 1071 is returned in this
case.

[[purgedata_examples]]
=== Examples of PURGEDATA

* This example purges the data in the specified table. If the table has
indexes, their data is also purged.
+
```
PURGEDATA myschema.mytable;
```

<<<
[[unload_statement]]
== UNLOAD Statement

The UNLOAD statement unloads data from Trafodion tables into an HDFS
location that you specify. Extracted data can be either compressed or
uncompressed based on what you choose.

UNLOAD is a Trafodion SQL extension.

```
UNLOAD [WITH option[ option]...] INTO 'target-location' SELECT ... FROM source-table ...

option is:
    DELIMITER { 'delimiter-string' | delimiter-ascii-value }
  | RECORD_SEPARATOR { 'separator-literal' | separator-ascii-value }
  | NULL_STRING 'string-literal'
  | PURGEDATA FROM TARGET
  | COMPRESSION GZIP
  | MERGE FILE merged_file-path [OVERWRITE]
  | NO OUTPUT
  | { NEW | EXISTING } SNAPSHOT HAVING SUFFIX 'string'
```

[[unload_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of UNLOAD

* `'_target-location_'`
+
is the full pathname of the target HDFS folder where the extracted data
will be written. Enclose the name of folder in single quotes. Specify
the folder name as a full pathname and not as a relative path. You must
have write permissions on the target HDFS folder. If you run UNLOAD in
parallel, multiple files will be produced under the _target-location_.
The number of files created will equal the number of ESPs.

* `SELECT &#8230; FROM _source-table_ &#8230;`
+
is either a simple query or a complex one that contains GROUP BY, JOIN,
or UNION clauses. _source-table_ is the name of a Trafodion table that
has the source data. See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `[WITH _option_[ _option_]&#8230;]`
+
is a set of options that you can specify for the unload operation. If
you specify an option more than once, Trafodion returns an error with
SQLCODE -4489. You can specify one or more of these options:

** `DELIMITER { '_delimiter-string_' | _delimiter-ascii-value_ }`
+
specifies the delimiter as either a delimiter string or an ASCII value.
If you do not specify this option, Trafodion uses the character "|" as
the delimiter.

*** _delimiter-string_ can be any ASCII or Unicode string. You can also
specify the delimiter as an ASCII value. Valid values range from 1 to 255.
Specify the value in decimal notation; hexadecimal or octal
notation are currently not supported. If you are using an ASCII value,
the delimiter can be only one character wide. Do not use quotes when
specifying an ASCII value for the delimiter.

** `RECORD_SEPARATOR { '_separator-literal_' | _separator-ascii-value_ }`
+
specifies the character that will be used to separate consecutive
records or rows in the output file. You can specify either a literal
or an ASCII value for the separator. The default value is a newline character.

*** _separator-literal_ can be any ASCII or Unicode character. You can also
specify the separator as an ASCII value. Valid values range from 1 to 255.
Specify the value in decimal notation; hexadecimal or octal
notation are currently not supported. If you are using an ASCII value,
the separator can be only one character wide. Do not use quotes when
specifying an ASCII value for the separator.

** `NULL_STRING '_string-literal_'`
+
specifies the string that will be used to indicate a NULL value. The
default value is the empty string ''.

** `PURGEDATA FROM TARGET`
+
causes files in the target HDFS folder to be deleted before the unload
operation.

** `COMPRESSION GZIP`
+
uses gzip compression in the extract node, writing the data to disk in
this compressed format. GZIP is currently the only supported type of
compression. If you do not specify this option, the extracted data will
be uncompressed.

** `MERGE FILE _merged_file-path_ [OVERWRITE]`
+
merges the unloaded files into one single file in the specified
_merged-file-path_. If you specify compression, the unloaded data will
be in compressed format, and the merged file will also be in compressed
format. If you specify the optional OVERWRITE keyword, the file is
overwritten if it already exists; otherwise, Trafodion raises an error
if the file already exists.

** `NO OUTPUT`
+
prevents the UNLOAD statement from displaying status messages. By
default, the UNLOAD statement prints status messages listing the steps
that the Bulk Unloader is executing.

<<<
* `{ NEW | EXISTING } SNAPSHOT HAVING SUFFIX '_string_'`
+
initiates an HBase snapshot scan during the unload operation. During a
snapshot scan, the Bulk Unloader will get a list of the Trafodion tables
from the query explain plan and will create and verify snapshots for the
tables. Specify a suffix string, '_string_', which will be appended to
each table name.

[[unload_considerations]]
=== Considerations for UNLOAD

* You must have write permissions on the target HDFS folder.
* If a WITH option is specified more than once, Trafodion returns an
error with SQLCODE -4489.

[[unload_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue an UNLOAD statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the target table.
* You have the SELECT privilege on the target table.
* You have the MANAGE_LOAD component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS
component.

[[unload_examples]]
=== Examples of UNLOAD

* This example shows how the UNLOAD statement extracts data from a
Trafodion table, `TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS`, into an HDFS
folder, `/bulkload/customer_demographics`:
+
```
>>UNLOAD
+>WITH PURGEDATA FROM TARGET
+>MERGE FILE 'merged_customer_demogs.gz' OVERWRITE
+>COMPRESSION GZIP

```

<<<
[[update_statistics_statement]]
== UPDATE STATISTICS Statement

The UPDATE STATISTICS statement updates the histogram statistics for one
or more groups of columns within a table. These statistics are used to
devise optimized access plans.

UPDATE STATISTICS is a Trafodion SQL extension.

```
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR TABLE table [CLEAR | on-clause]

on-clause is:
    ON column-group-list CLEAR
  | ON column-group-list [histogram-option]...

column-group-list is:
    column-list [,column-list]...
  | EVERY COLUMN [,column-list]...
  | EVERY KEY [,column-list]...
  | EXISTING COLUMN[S] [,column-list]...
  | NECESSARY COLUMN[S] [,column-list]...

column-list for a single-column group is:
    column-name
  | (column-name)
  | column-name TO column-name
  | (column-name) TO (column-name)
  | column-name TO (column-name)
  | (column-name) TO column-name

column-list for a multicolumn group is:
    (column-name, column-name [,column-name]...)

histogram-option is:
    GENERATE n INTERVALS
  | SAMPLE [sample-option]

sample-option is:
    [r ROWS]
  | RANDOM percent PERCENT
  | PERIODIC size ROWS EVERY period ROWS
```

[[update_statistics_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of UPDATE STATISTICS

* `_table_`
+
names the table for which statistics are to be updated. To refer to a
table, use the ANSI logical name.
See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `CLEAR`
+
deletes some or all histograms for the table _table_. Use this option
when new applications no longer use certain histogram statistics.
+
If you do not specify _column-group-list_, all histograms for _table_
are deleted. If you specify _column-group-list_, only columns in the
group list are deleted.

* `ON _column-group-list_`
+
specifies one or more groups of columns for which to generate histogram
statistics with the option of clearing the histogram statistics. You
must use the ON clause to generate statistics stored in histogram
tables.

* `_column-list_`
+
specifies how _column-group-list_ can be defined. The column list
represents both a single-column group and a multi-column group.

** Single-column group:

*** `_column-name_ | (_column-name_) | _column-name_ TO _column-name_ |
(_column-name_) TO (_column-name_)`
+
specifies how you can specify individual columns or a group of
individual columns.
+
To generate statistics for individual columns, list each column. You can
list each single column name within or without parentheses.

** Multicolumn group:

*** `(_column-name_, _column-name_ [,_column-name_]&#8230;)`
+
specifies a multi-column group.
+
To generate multi-column statistics, group a set of columns within
parentheses, as shown. You cannot specify the name of a column more than
once in the same group of columns.
+
<<<
+
One histogram is generated for each unique column group. Duplicate
groups, meaning any permutation of the same group of columns, are
ignored and processing continues. When you run UPDATE STATISTICS again
for the same user table, the new data for that table replaces the data
previously generated and stored in the table’s histogram tables.
Histograms of column groups not specified in the ON clause remain
unchanged in histogram tables.
+
For more information about specifying columns, see
<<generating_and_clearing_statistics_for_columns,Generating and Clearing Statistics for Columns>>.

* `EVERY COLUMN`
+
The EVERY COLUMN keyword indicates that histogram statistics are to be
generated for each individual column of _table_ and any multicolumns
that make up the primary key and indexes. For example, _table_ has
columns A, B, C, D defined, where A, B, C compose the primary key. In
this case, the ON EVERY COLUMN option generates a single column
histogram for columns A, B, C, D, and two multi-column histograms of (A,
B, C) and (A, B).
+
The EVERY COLUMN option does what EVERY KEY does, with additional
statistics on the individual columns.

* `EVERY KEY`
+
The EVERY KEY keyword indicates that histogram statistics are to be
generated for columns that make up the primary key and indexes. For
example, _table_ has columns A, B, C, D defined. If the primary key
comprises columns A, B, statistics are generated for (A, B), A and B. If
the primary key comprises columns A, B, C, statistics are generated for
(A,B,C), (A,B), A, B, C. If the primary key comprises columns A, B, C,
D, statistics are generated for (A, B, C, D), (A, B, C), (A, B), and A,
B, C, D.

* `EXISTING COLUMN[S]`
+
The EXISTING COLUMN keyword indicates that all existing histograms of
the table are to be updated. Statistics must be previously captured to
establish existing columns.

* `NECESSARY COLUMN[S]`
+
The NECESSARY COLUMN[S] keyword generates statistics for histograms that
the optimizer has requested but do not exist. Update statistics
automation must be enabled for NECESSARY COLUMN[S] to generate
statistics. To enable automation, see <<update_statistics_automating_update_statistics,
Automating Update Statistics>>.

<<<
* `_histogram-option_`

** `GENERATE _n_ INTERVALS`
+
The GENERATE _n_ INTERVALS option for UPDATE STATISTICS accepts values
between 1 and 10,000. Keep in mind that increasing the number of
intervals per histograms may have a negative impact on compile time.
+
Increasing the number of intervals can be used for columns with small
set of possible values and large variance of the frequency of these
values. For example, consider a column ‘CITY’ in table SALES, which
stores the city code where the item was sold, where number of cities in
the sales data is 1538. Setting the number of intervals to a number
greater or equal to the number of cities (that is, setting the number of
intervals to 1600) guarantees that the generated histogram captures the
number of rows for each city. If the specified value n exceeds the
number of unique values in the column, the system generates only as many
intervals as the number of unique values.

** `SAMPLE [_sample-option_]`
+
is a clause that specifies that sampling is to be used to gather a
subset of the data from the table. UPDATE STATISTICS stores the sample
results and generates histograms.
+
If you specify the SAMPLE clause without additional options, the result
depends on the number of rows in the table. If the table contains no
more than 10,000 rows, the entire table will be read (no sampling). If
the number of rows is greater than 10,000 but less than 1 million,
10,000 rows are randomly sampled from the table. If there are more than
1 million rows in the table, a random row sample is used to read 1
percent of the rows in the table, with a maximum of 1 million rows
sampled.
+
TIP: As a guideline, the default sample of 1 percent of the rows in the
table, with a maximum of 1 million rows, provides good statistics for
the optimizer to generate good plans.
+
If you do not specify the SAMPLE clause, if the table has fewer rows
than specified, or if the sample size is greater than the system limit,
Trafodion SQL reads all rows from _table_. See <<sample_clause,SAMPLE Clause>>.

*** `_sample-option_`

**** `r_ rows`
+
A row sample is used to read _r_ rows from the table. The value _r_ must
be an integer that is greater than zero 

<<<
**** `RANDOM _percent_ PERCENT`
+
directs Trafodion SQL to choose rows randomly from the table. The value
percent must be a value between zero and 100 (0 < percent &#60;= 100). In
addition, only the first four digits to the right of the decimal point
are significant. For example, value 0.00001 is considered to be 0.0000,
Value 1.23456 is considered to be 1.2345.

**** `PERIODIC _size_ ROWS EVERY _period_ ROW`
+
directs Trafodion SQL to choose the first _size_ number of rows from
each _period_ of rows. The value _size_ must be an integer that is
greater than zero and less than or equal to the value _period_. (0 <
_size_ &#60;= _period_). The size of the _period_ is defined by the number
of rows specified for _period_. The value _period_ must be an integer
that is greater than zero (_period_ > 0).

[[update_statistics_considerations]]
=== Considerations for UPDATE STATISTICS

[[update_statistics_using_statistics]]
==== Using Statistics

Use UPDATE STATISTICS to collect and save statistics on columns. The SQL
compiler uses histogram statistics to determine the selectivity of
predicates, indexes, and tables. Because selectivity directly influences
the cost of access plans, regular collection of statistics increases the
likelihood that Trafodion SQL chooses efficient access plans.

While UPDATE STATISTICS is running on a table, the table is active and
available for query access.

When a user table is changed, either by changing its data significantly
or its definition, re-execute the UPDATE STATISTICS statement for the
table.

[[update_statistics_histogram_statistics]]
==== Histogram Statistics

Histogram statistics are used by the compiler to produce the best plan
for a given SQL query. When histograms are not available, default
assumptions are made by the compiler and the resultant plan might not
perform well. Histograms that reflect the latest data in a table are
optimal.

The compiler does not need histogram statistics for every column of a
table. For example, if a column is only in the select list, its
histogram statistics will be irrelevant. A histogram statistic is useful
when a column appears in:

* A predicate
* A GROUP BY column
* An ORDER BY clause
* A HAVING clause
* Or similar clause

In addition to single-column histogram statistics, the compiler needs
multi-column histogram statistics, such as when group by column-5,
column-3, column-19 appears in a query. Then, histogram statistics for
the combination (column-5, column-3, column-19) are needed.

[[update_statistics_required-privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To perform an UPDATE STATISTICS operation, one of the following must be
true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the target table.
* You have the MANAGE_STATISTICS component privilege for the
SQL_OPERATIONS component.

[[update_statistics_locking]]
==== Locking

UPDATE STATISTICS momentarily locks the definition of the user table
during the operation but not the user table itself. The UPDATE
STATISTICS statement uses READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level for the user
table.

<<<
[[update_statistics_transactions]]
==== Transactions

Do not start a transaction before executing UPDATE STATISTICS. UPDATE
STATISTICS runs multiple transactions of its own, as needed. Starting
your own transaction in which UPDATE STATISTICS runs could cause the
transaction auto abort time to be exceeded during processing.

[[update_statistics_generating_and_clearing_statistics_for_columns]]
==== Generating and Clearing Statistics for Columns

To generate statistics for particular columns, name each column, or name
the first and last columns of a sequence of columns in the table. For
example, suppose that a table has consecutive columns CITY, STATE, ZIP.
This list gives a few examples of possible options you can specify:

[cols="25%,37%,37%",options="header"]
|===
| Single-Column Group   | Single-Column Group Within Parentheses | Multicolumn Group
| ON CITY, STATE, ZIP   | ON (CITY),(STATE),(ZIP)                | ON (CITY, STATE) or ON (CITY,STATE,ZIP)
| ON CITY TO ZIP        | ON (CITY) TO (ZIP)                     |
| ON ZIP TO CITY        | ON (ZIP) TO (CITY)                     |
| ON CITY, STATE TO ZIP | ON (CITY), (STATE) TO (ZIP)            |
| ON CITY TO STATE, ZIP | ON (CITY) TO (STATE), (ZIP)            |
|===

The TO specification is useful when a table has many columns, and you
want histograms on a subset of columns. Do not confuse (CITY) TO (ZIP)
with (CITY, STATE, ZIP), which refers to a multi-column histogram.

You can clear statistics in any combination of columns you specify, not
necessarily with the _column-group-list_ you used to create statistics.
However, those statistics will remain until you clear them.

<<<
[[update_statistics_column_lists_and_access_plans]]
==== Column Lists and Access Plans

Generate statistics for columns most often used in data access plans for
a table—that is, the primary key, indexes defined on the table, and any
other columns frequently referenced in predicates in WHERE or GROUP BY
clauses of queries issued on the table. Use the EVERY COLUMN option to
generate histograms for every individual column or multicolumns that
make up the primary key and indexes.

The EVERY KEY option generates histograms that make up the primary key
and indexes.

If you often perform a GROUP BY over specific columns in a table, use
multi-column lists in the UPDATE STATISTICS statement (consisting of the
columns in the GROUP BY clause) to generate histogram statistics that
enable the optimizer to choose a better plan. Similarly, when a query
joins two tables by two or more columns, multi-column lists (consisting
of the columns being joined) help the optimizer choose a better plan.

[[update_statistics_automating_update_statistics]]
==== Automating Update Statistics

To enable update statistics automation, set the Control Query Default
(CQD) attribute, USTAT_AUTOMATION_INTERVAL, in a session where you will
run update statistics operations. For example:

```
control query default USTAT_AUTOMATION_INTERVAL '1440';
```

The value of USTAT_AUTOMATION_INTERVAL is intended to be an automation
interval (in minutes), but, in Trafodion Release 1.0, this value does
not act as a timing interval. Instead, any value greater than zero
enables update statistics automation.

After enabling update statistics automation, prepare each of the queries
that you want to optimize. For example:

```
prepare s from select...;
```

The PREPARE statement causes the Trafodion SQL compiler to compile and
optimize a query without executing it. When preparing queries with
update statistic automation enabled, any histograms needed by the
optimizer that are not present will cause those columns to be marked as
needing histograms.

Next, run this UPDATE STATISTICS statement against each table, using ON
NECESSARY COLUMN[S] to generate the needed histograms:

```
update statistics for table _table-name_ on necessary columns sample;
```

<<<
[[update_statistics_examples]]
=== Examples of UPDATE STATISTICS

* This example generates four histograms for the columns jobcode,
empnum, deptnum, and (empnum, deptnum) for the table EMPLOYEE. Depending
on the table’s size and data distribution, each histogram should contain
ten intervals.
+
```
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR TABLE employee
ON (jobcode),(empnum, deptnum) GENERATE 10 INTERVALS;

--- SQL operation complete.
```

* This example generates histogram statistics using the ON EVERY COLUMN
option for the table DEPT. This statement performs a full scan, and
Trafodion SQL determines the default number of intervals.
+
```
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR TABLE dept ON EVERY COLUMN;

--- SQL operation complete.
```

* Suppose that a construction company has an ADDRESS table of potential
sites and a DEMOLITION_SITES table that contains some of the columns of
the ADDRESS table. The primary key is ZIP. Join these two tables on two
of the columns in common:
+
```
SELECT COUNT(AD.number), AD.street,
       AD.city, AD.zip, AD.state
FROM address AD, demolition_sites DS
WHERE AD.zip = DS.zip AND AD.type = DS.type
GROUP BY AD.street, AD.city, AD.zip, AD.state;
```
+
To generate statistics specific to this query, enter these statements:
+
```
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR TABLE address
ON (street), (city), (state), (zip, type);

UPDATE STATISTICS FOR TABLE demolition_sites ON (zip, type);
```

* This example removes all histograms for table DEMOLITION_SITES:
+
```
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR TABLE demolition_sites CLEAR;
```

<<<
* This example selectively removes the histogram for column STREET in
table ADDRESS:
+
```
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR TABLE address ON street CLEAR;
```
