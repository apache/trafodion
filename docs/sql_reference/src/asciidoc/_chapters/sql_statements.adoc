= SQL Statements

This section describes the syntax and semantics of {project-name} SQL statements.

{project-name} SQL statements are entered interactively or from script files using a client-based tool, such as the
{project-name} Command Interface (TrafCI). To install and configure a client application that enables you to connect
to and use a {project-name} database, see the
{docs-url}/client_install/index.html[_{project-name} Client Installation_ _Guide_].

[[sql_statements_categories]]
== Categories

The statements are categorized according to their functionality:

=== Data Definition Language (DDL) Statements

Use these DDL statements to create, drop, or alter the definition of a {project-name} SQL schema or object.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run DDL statements inside a user-defined
transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run these statements, AUTOCOMMIT must be turned ON
(the default) for the session.

[[alter_library_statement]]
== ALTER LIBRARY Statement

The ALTER LIBRARY statement updates the physical filename for a library object in a {project-name} database.
A library object can be an SPJ's JAR file or a UDF's library file.

ALTER LIBRARY is a {project-name} SQL extension.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run this statement inside 
user-defined transaction (`BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK`) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run this statement, AUTOCOMMIT must be
turned ON (the default) for the session.

```
ALTER LIBRARY [[catalog-name.]schema-name.]library-name
   file library-filename
   [host name host-name]
   [local file host-filename]
```

[[alter_library_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of ALTER LIBRARY

* `\[[_catalog-name_.]_schema-name_.]_library-name_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of the library object, where each part of the name is a valid sql identifier with a maximum of 128 characters.
specify the name of a library object that has already been registered in the schema. if you do not fully qualify the library name, trafodion sql
qualifies it according to the schema of the current session. for more information, see <<identifiers,identifiers>> and
<<_database_object_names,database object names>>.

* `file _library-filename_`
+
specifies the full path of the redeployed library file, which either an SPJ's jar file or a UDF's library file.

* `host name _host-name_`
+
specifies the name of the client host machine where the deployed file resides.

* `local file _host-filename_`
+
specifies the path on the client host machine where the deployed file is stored.

<<<
[[alter_library_considerations]]
=== Considerations for ALTER LIBRARY

* HOST NAME and LOCAL FILE are position dependent.

==== Required Privileges

To issue an ALTER LIBRARY statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the library.
* You have the ALTER or ALTER_LIBRARY component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

[[alter_library_examples]]
=== Examples of ALTER LIBRARY

* This ALTER LIBRARY statement updates the JAR file (SPJs) for a library named SALESLIB in the SALES schema:
+
```
ALTER LIBRARY sales.saleslib FILE Sales2.jar;`
```

* This ALTER LIBRARY statement updates the library file (UDFs) for a library named MYUDFS in the default schema:
+
```
ALTER LIBRARY myudfs FILE $TMUDFLIB;
```

[[alter_sequence_statement]]
== ALTER SEQUENCE Statement

The ALTER SEQUENCE Statement changes the future behavior of exiting sequence, including `INCREMENT`, `MAXVALUE`, `CACHE` and `CYCLE`. 

Multiple options can be concurrently specified and separated by a space. Any options not altered will
retain their previous settings.

ALTER SEQUENCE is a Trafodion SQL extension.

For more inforamation, see <<create_sequence_statement,CREATE SEQUENCE Statement>> or <<drop_sequence_statement,DROP SEQUENCE Statement>>.

```
ALTER SEQUENCE [[catalog-name.]schema-name.]sequence-name
[INCREMENT BY integer]
[MAXVALUE integer | NO MAXVALUE]
[CACHE integer]
[CYCLE | NO CYCLE]
```
<<<
[[alter_sequence_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of ALTER SEQUENCE

The options above serve the same purposes as they serve when you create a sequence. For more information, see <<create_sequence_statement,CREATE SEQUENCE Statement>>.

NOTE:

* `START WITH`, `MINVALUE`, `NO CACHE` and `DATA TYPE` cannot be changed. Instead, drop and recreate the sequence with desired options.

* The unused preallocated values will be lost if a sequence is altered.

* Some sequence values will be skipped if you change the `INCREMENT BY` before the first reference to `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, NEXT)`.

+
For example,

+
** Create _sequence1_.
+
```
SQL>CREATE SEQUENCE sequence1
START WITH        1
INCREMENT BY      1;

--- SQL operation complete.
```

+
** Change `INCREMENT BY` to 6.
+
```
SQL>ALTER SEQUENCE sequence1 
INCREMENT BY 6;

--- SQL operation complete.
```

+
** It always returns the initial value of the sequence by calling `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, CURRENT)` or `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, NEXT)` for the first time, so the fisrt reference to `SEQNUM(_sequence1_, NEXT)` is 1.

+
```
SQL>SELECT SEQNUM(sequence1, NEXT) FROM DUAL;

(EXPR)
--------------------
                   1

--- 1 row(s) selected.
```

+
** It returns a new incremented value of the sequence with each subsequent reference to `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, NEXT)`. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are skipped because `INCREMENT BY` is changed to 6 before the first reference to `SEQNUM(_sequence1_, NEXT)`.
+
```
SQL>SELECT SEQNUM(sequence1, NEXT) FROM DUAL;

(EXPR)
--------------------
                   7

* `_table-name_`
+
specifies the current name of the object. See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `ADD [IF NOT EXISTS][COLUMN] _column-definition_`
+
adds a column to _table_.
+
The clauses for the `_column-definition_` are:

** `_column-name_`
+
specifies the name for the new column in the table. _column-name_ is an SQL identifier. _column-name_ must be
unique among column names in the table. If the column name is a {project-name} SQL reserved word, you must
delimit it by enclosing it in double quotes. For example: `"sql".myview`. See <<Identifiers,Identifiers>>.

** `_data-type_`
+
specifies the data type of the values that can be stored in _column-name_. See <<Data_Types,Data Types>>
If a default is not specified, NULL is used.

** `DEFAULT _default_`
+
specifies a default value for the column or specifies that the column does not have a default value. You can declare the default value
explicitly by using the DEFAULT clause, or you can enable null to be used as the default by omitting both the DEFAULT and NOT NULL clauses.
If you omit the DEFAULT clause and specify NOT NULL, {project-name} SQL returns an error. For existing rows of the table, the added column takes
on its default value.
+
If you set the default to the datetime value CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, {project-name} SQL uses January 1, 1 A.D.
12:00:00.000000 as the default date and time for the existing rows.
+
For any row that you add after the column is added, if no value is specified for the column as part of the add row operation, the column
receives a default value based on the current timestamp at the time the row is added.

specifies a name for the column or table constraint. _constraint-name_ must have the same schema as _table_ and must be
unique among constraint names in its schema. If you omit the schema portions of the name you specify in _constraint-name_,
trafodion sql expands the constraint name by using the schema for _table_. See <<database_object_names,database object names>>.
+
if you do not specify a constraint name, trafodion sql constructs an sql identifier as the name for the constraint in the schema
for _table._ The identifier consists of the fully qualified table name concatenated with a system-generated unique identifier.
for example, a constraint on table a.b.c might be assigned a name such as a.b.c_123&#8230;_01&#8230;.

*** `_column-constraint_` options:

**** `NOT NULL` 
+
is a column constraint that specifies that the column cannot contain nulls. If you omit not null, nulls are allowed in the column.
If you specify both not null and no default, then each row inserted in the table must include a value for the column. See <<null,null>>.

**** `UNIQUE`
+
is a column constraint that specifies that the column cannot contain more than one occurrence of the same value. If you omit unique,
duplicate values are allowed unless the column is part of the primary key. Columns that you define as unique must be specified as not null.

**** `PRIMARY KEY [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]`
+
is a column constraint that specifies a column as the primary key for the table.
+
ASCENDING and DESCENDING specify the direction for entries in one column within the key. The default is ASCENDING.
+
The PRIMARY KEY value in each row of the table must be unique within the table. You can specify PRIMARY KEY only once on any CREATE TABLE statement.
+
Trafodion SQL uses the primary key as the clustering key of the table to avoid creating a separate, unique index to implement
the primary key constraint.

**** `CHECK (_condition_)`
+
is a constraint that specifies a condition that must be satisfied for each row in the table. see <<search_condition,search condition>>.
you cannot refer to the current_date, current_time, or current_timestamp function in a check constraint, and you cannot use
subqueries in a check constraint.

<<<
**** `REFERENCES _ref-spec_`
+
specifies a references column constraint. The maximum combined length of the columns for a references constraint is 2048 bytes. +

***** `_ref-spec_` is:
+
`_referenced-table_ [(_column-list_)]`
+
****** `_referenced-table_` is the table referenced by the foreign key in a referential constraint. _referenced-table_ cannot be a view.
_referenced-table_ cannot be the same as _table_. _referenced-table_ corresponds to the foreign key in the _table_.
 +
****** `_column-list_` specifies the column or set of columns in the _referenced-table_ that corresponds to the foreign key in _table_. the
columns in the column list associated with references must be in the same order as the columns in the column list associated with foreign
key. if _column-list_ is omitted, the referenced table's primary key columns are the referenced columns.
+
a table can have an unlimited number of referential constraints, and you can specify the same foreign key in more than one referential
constraint, but you must define each referential constraint separately. you cannot create self-referencing foreign key constraints.


* `ADD [constraint _constraint-name_] _table-constraint_`
+
adds a constraint to the table and optionally specifies _constraint-name_ as the name for the constraint. the new constraint
must be consistent with any data already present in the table. 

<<<
** `CONSTRAINT _constraint-name_`
+
specifies a name for the column or table constraint. _constraint-name_ must have the same schema as _table_ and must be unique among constraint
names in its schema. If you omit the schema portions of the name you specify in _constraint-name_, trafodion sql expands the constraint
name by using the schema for table. See <<database_object_names,database object names>>. 
+
if you do not specify a constraint name, trafodion sql constructs an sql identifier as the name for the constraint in the schema for table. The
identifier consists of the fully qualified table name concatenated with a system-generated unique identifier. For example, a constraint on table
a.b.c might be assigned a name such as a.b.c_123&#8230;_01&#8230;.
+
** `_table-constraint_` options:

*** `UNIQUE (_column-list_)`
+
is a table constraint that specifies that the column or set of columns cannot contain more 
than one occurrence of the same value or set of values.
+
**** `_column-list_` cannot include more than one occurrence of the same column. In addition, the set of columns that you specify on a unique
constraint cannot match the set of columns on any other unique constraint for the table or on the primary key constraint for the table.
all columns defined as unique must be specified as not null.
+
a unique constraint is enforced with a unique index. If there is already a unique index on _column-list_, trafodion sql uses that index. if a
unique index does not exist, the system creates a unique index.

*** `CHECK (_condition_)`
+
is a constraint that specifies a condition that must be satisfied for each row in the table.
see <<search_condition,search condition>>. You cannot refer to the current_date, current_time, or current_timestamp function in a check constraint, and you cannot use subqueries in a check constraint.

*** `FOREIGN KEY (_column-list_) references _ref-spec_ NOT ENFORCED`
+
is a table constraint that specifies a referential constraint for the table, declaring that a column or set of columns (called a foreign key) in _table_ can contain only values that match those in a column or set of columns in the table specified in the references clause. However if `NOT ENFORCED` is specified, this relationship is not checked.
+
the two columns or sets of columns must have the same characteristics (data type, length, scale, precision). Without the foreign key clause,
the foreign key in _table_ is the column being defined; with the foreign key clause, the foreign key is the column or set of columns specified in
the foreign key clause. For information about _ref-spec_, see references _ref-spec_ not enforced.

<<<
* ENABLE ALL [UNIQUE] INDEXES

** ENABLE ALL UNIQUE INDEXES
+
enables all unique indexes on the table.

** ENABLE ALL INDEXES
+
enables all indexes (including both non-unique and unique indexes) on the table.

* _index-name_
+
is an SQL identifier that specifies the simple name for the index. You cannot qualify index-name with its schema name. 
Indexes have their own name space within a schema, 
so an index name might be the same as a table or constraint name. However, no two indexes in a schema can have the same name.

* ENABLE INDEX _index-name_ 
+
enables an index on the table.

* DISABLE INDEX _index-name_
+
disables an index on the table.
The index still exists in the data, but it will not 
be chosen by the optimizer as an access path.

<<<
* `drop constraint _constraint-name_ [restrict]`
+
drops a constraint from the table. +
+
if you drop a constraint, trafodion sql drops its dependent index if trafodion sql originally created the same index. if the constraint uses
an existing index, the index is not dropped. +

** `constraint _constraint-name_`
+
specifies a name for the column or table constraint. _constraint-name_ must have the same schema as _table_ and must be unique among constraint
names in its schema. if you omit the schema portions of the name you specify in _constraint-name_, trafodion sql expands the constraint
name by using the schema for table. see <<database_object_names,database object names>>.
+
if you do not specify a constraint name, trafodion sql constructs an sql identifier as the name for the constraint in the schema for table. the
identifier consists of the fully qualified table name concatenated with a system-generated unique identifier. for example, a constraint on table
a.b.c might be assigned a name such as a.b.c_123&#8230;_01&#8230;.

* `rename to _new-name_`
+
changes the logical name of the object within the same schema.

** `_new-name_`
+
specifies the new name of the object after the rename to operation occurs.

<<<
* `add if not exists _column-definition_`
+
adds a column to _table_ if it does not already exist in the table.
+
the clauses for the _column-definition_ are the same as described in add [column] _column-definition_.

* `drop [column] [if exists] _column-name_`
+
drops the specified column from _table_, including the column’s data. you cannot drop a primary key column.

* `alter column _column-definition_`
+
alters the data-type of a column in an existing Trafodion table. The following conditions have to be met, else SQL error 1404 will be returned.

** the old (existing) column datatype and new column datatype must be compatible.
** new column length must be greater than or equal to old column length.
** old and new character sets must be the same.
** altered columns cannot be part of primary key or secondary index key.
** table cannot be a VOLATILE table.

[[alter_table_considerations]]
=== Considerations for ALTER TABLE

[[effect_of_adding_a_column_on_view_definitions]]
==== Effect of Adding a Column on View Definitions

The addition of a column to a table has no effect on existing view definitions. Implicit column references specified by SELECT * in view
definitions are replaced by explicit column references when the definition clauses are originally evaluated.

[[authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

ALTER TABLE works only on user-created tables.

===== Required Privileges

To issue an ALTER TABLE statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the table.
* You have the ALTER or ALTER_TABLE component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

===== Privileges Needed to Create a Referential Integrity Constraint

To create a referential integrity constraint (that is, a constraint on the table that refers to a column in another table), one of the
following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the referencing and referenced tables.
* You have these privileges on the referencing and referenced table:
** For the referencing table, you have the ALTER or ALTER_TABLE component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
** For the referenced table, you have the REFERENCES (or ALL) privilege on the referenced table through your user name or through a granted role.

If the constraint refers to the other table in a query expression, you must also have SELECT privileges on the other table.

=== Syntax Description of ALTER USER

* `_database-username_`
+
is the name of a currently registered database user.

* `SET EXTERNAL NAME`
+
changes the name that identifies the user in the directory service. This is also the name the user specifies when
connecting to the database.

** `_directory-service-username_`
+
specifies the new name of the user in the directory service.

** `_directory-service-username_` is a regular or delimited case-insensitive
identifier. See <<Case_Insensitive_Delimited_Identifiers,Case-Insensitive Delimited Identifiers>>.

* `SET { ONLINE | OFFLINE }`
+
changes the attribute that controls whether the user is allowed to connect to the database. +

** `ONLINE`
+
specifies that the user is allowed to connect to the database.

** `OFFLINE`

[[call_statement]]
== CALL Statement

The CALL statement invokes a stored procedure in Java (SPJ) in a {project-name} SQL database.

```
CALL procedure-ref ([argument-list])

procedure-ref is:
   [[catalog-name.]schema-name.]procedure-name

argument-list is:
   sql-expression[, sql-expression]...
```

[[call_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CALL

* `_procedure-ref_`
+
specifies an ANSI logical name of the form:
+
`_[[catalog-name.]schema-name.]procedure-name_`
+
where each part of the name is a valid sql identifier with a maximum of 128 characters. for more information, see
<<identifiers,identifiers>> and <<database_object_names,database object names>>.
+
if you do not fully qualify the procedure name, trafodion sql qualifies it according to the schema of the current session.

* `_argument-list_`
+
accepts arguments for in, in-out, or out parameters. the arguments consist of sql expressions, including dynamic parameters,
separated by commas:
+
`_sql-expression_[{, _sql-expression_}&#8230;]`
+
<<<
+
each expression must evaluate to a value of one of these data types:
+
** character value
** date-time value
** numeric value
+
interval value expressions are disallowed in SPJs. for more information, see
<<call_input_parameter_arguments,input parameter arguments>> and
<<call_output_parameter_arguments,output parameter arguments>>.
+
do not specify result sets in the argument list.

[[call_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CALL

[[call_usage_restrictions]]
==== Usage Restrictions

You can use a CALL statement as a stand-alone SQL statement in applications or command-line interfaces,
such as TrafCI. You cannot use a CALL statement inside a compound statement or with row sets.

[[call_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a CALL statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the stored procedure.
* You have the EXECUTE (or ALL) privileges, either directly through your username or through a granted role.
For more information, see the <<GRANT_Statement,GRANT Statement>>.

When the stored procedure executes, it executes as the {project-name} ID.

<<<
[[call_input_parameter_argument]]
==== Input Parameter Arguments

You pass data to an SPJ by using IN or INOUT parameters. For an IN
parameter argument, use one of these SQL expressions:

* Literal
* SQL function (including CASE and CAST expressions)
* Arithmetic or concatenation operation
* Scalar subquery
* Dynamic parameter (for example, ?) in an application
* Named (for example, ?param) or unnamed (for example, ?) parameter in TrafCI

For an INOUT parameter argument, you can use only a dynamic, named, or unnamed parameter. For more information, see
<<Expressions,Expressions>>.

[[call_output_parameter_arguments]]
==== Output Parameter Arguments

An SPJ returns values in OUT and INOUT parameters. Output parameter arguments must be dynamic parameters in an
application (for example, ?) or named or unnamed parameters in DCI (for example, ?param or ?). Each
calling application defines the semantics of the OUT and INOUT parameters in its environment.

[[call_data_conversion_parameter_arguments]]
==== Data Conversion of Parameter Arguments

{project-name} SQL performs an implicit data conversion when the data type of a parameter argument is compatible with
but does not match the formal data type of the stored procedure. For stored procedure input values,
the conversion is from the actual argument value to the formal parameter type. For stored procedure output values,
the conversion is from the actual output value, which has the data type of the formal parameter, to the declared
type of the dynamic parameter.

[[call_null_input_and_output]]
==== Null Input and Output

You can pass a null value as input to or output from an SPJ, provided that the corresponding Java data type of the
parameter supports nulls. If a null is input or output for a parameter that does not support nulls, {project-name} SQL
returns an error.

<<<
[[call_transaction_semantics]]
==== Transaction Semantics

The CALL statement automatically initiates a transaction if no active transaction exists. However, the failure of
a CALL statement does not always automatically abort the transaction.

[[call_examples]]
=== Examples of CALL

* In TrafCI, execute an SPJ named MONTHLYORDERS, which has one IN parameter represented by a literal and one OUT
parameter represented by an unnamed parameter, ?:
+
```
CALL sales.monthlyorders(3,?);
```

<<<
* This CALL statement executes a stored procedure, which accepts one IN parameter (a date literal), returns one OUT
parameter (a row from the column, NUM_ORDERS), and returns two result sets:
+
```
CALL sales.ordersummary('01/01/2001', ?);

[[commit_work_statement]]
== COMMIT WORK Statement

The COMMIT WORK statement commits any changes to objects made during the current transaction and ends
the transaction. See <<Transaction_Management,Transaction Management>>.

WORK is an optional keyword that has no effect.

COMMIT WORK issued outside of an active transaction generates error 8605.

```
COMMIT [WORK]
```

[[commit_work_considerations]]
=== Considerations for COMMIT WORK

BEGIN WORK starts a transaction. COMMIT WORK or ROLLBACK WORK ends a transaction.

<<<
[[commit_work_examples]]
=== Example of COMMIT WORK

Suppose that your application adds information to the inventory. You have received 24 terminals from
a new supplier and want to add the supplier and update the quantity on hand. The part number for the
terminals is 5100, and the supplier is assigned supplier number 17. The cost of each terminal is $800.

The transaction must add the order for terminals to PARTSUPP, add the supplier to the SUPPLIER table,
and update QTY_ON_HAND in PARTLOC. After the INSERT and UPDATE statements execute successfully,
you commit the transaction, as shown:

```
-- This statement initiates a transaction.
BEGIN WORK;

--- SQL operation complete.

-- This statement inserts a new entry into PARTSUPP.
INSERT INTO invent.partsupp
VALUES (5100, 17, 800.00, 24);

--- 1 row(s) inserted.

-- This statement inserts a new entry into SUPPLIER.
INSERT INTO invent.supplier
VALUES (17, 'Super Peripherals','751 Sanborn Way',
 'Santa Rosa', 'California', '95405');

--- 1 row(s) inserted.

-- This statement updates the quantity in PARTLOC.
UPDATE invent.partloc
SET qty_on_hand = qty_on_hand + 24
WHERE partnum = 5100 AND loc_code = 'G43';

--- 1 row(s) updated.

-- This statement ends a transaction.
COMMIT WORK;

--- SQL operation complete.

<<<
[[control_query_cancel_statement]]
== CONTROL QUERY CANCEL Statement

The CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement cancels an executing query that you identify with a query ID.
You can execute the CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement in a client-based tool like TrafCI or through any ODBC or JDBC
application.

CONTROL QUERY CANCEL is a {project-name} SQL extension.

```
CONTROL QUERY CANCEL QID query-id [COMMENT 'comment-text']
```

[[control_query_cancel_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

* `_query-id_`
+
specifies the query ID of an executing query, which is a unique identifier generated by the SQL compiler.

* `'_comment-text_'`
+
specifies an optional comment to be displayed in the canceled query’s error message.

[[control_query_cancel_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

[[control_query_cancel_benefitsl]]
==== Benefits of CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

For many queries, the CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement allows the termination of the query without stopping the
master executor process (MXOSRVR). This type of cancellation has these benefits over standard ODBC/JDBC cancel
methods:

* An ANSI-defined error message is returned to the client session, and SQLSTATE is set to HY008.
* Important cached objects persist after the query is canceled, including the master executor process and its
compiler, the compiled statements cached in the master, and the compiler’s query cache and its cached metadata
and histograms.
* The client does not need to reestablish its connection, and its prepared statements are preserved.
* When clients share connections using a middle-tier application server, the effects of canceling one client’s
executing query no longer affect other clients sharing the same connection.

[[control_query_cancel_restrictions]]
==== Restrictions on CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

Some executing queries may not respond to a CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement within a 60-second interval. For those
queries, {project-name} SQL stops their ESP processes if there are any. If this action allows the query to be canceled,
you will see all the benefits listed above.

If the executing query does not terminate within 120 seconds after the CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement is issued,
{project-name} SQL stops the master executor process, terminating the query and generating a lost connection error.
In this case, you will not see any of the benefits listed above. Instead, you will lose your connection and will
need to reconnect and re-prepare the query. This situation often occurs with the CALL, DDL, and utility statements
and rarely with other statements.

The CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement does not work with these statements:

* Unique queries, which operate on a single row and a single partition
* Queries that are not executing, such as a query that is being compiled
* CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT, BEGIN WORK, COMMIT WORK, ROLLBACK WORK, and EXPLAIN statements
* Statically compiled metadata queries
* Queries executed in anomalous conditions, such as queries without runtime statistics or without a query ID

[[control_query_cancel_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You own (that is, issued) the query.
* You have the QUERY_CANCEL component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

<<<
[[control_query_cancel_examples]]
=== Example of CONTROL QUERY CANCEL

This CONTROL QUERY CANCEL statement cancels a specified query and provides a comment concerning the cancel
operation:

```
control query cancel qid
MXID11000010941212288634364991407000000003806U3333300_156016_S1 comment
'Query is consuming too many resources.';
```

In a separate session, the client that issued the query will see this
error message indicating that the query has been canceled:

```
>>execute s1;

*** ERROR[8007] The operation has been canceled. Query is consuming too many resources.
```

<<<
[[control_query_default_statement]]
== CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT Statement

The CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement changes the default settings for the current process. You can execute
the CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement in a client-based tool like TrafCI or through any ODBC or JDBC application.

CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT is a {project-name} SQL extension.

```
{ CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT | CQD } control-default-option

control-default-option is:
  attribute {'attr-value' | RESET}
```

[[control_query_default_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT

* `_attribute_`
+
is a character string that represents an attribute name. For descriptions of these attributes,
see the {docs-url}/cqd_reference/index.html[{project-name} Control Query Default (CQD) Reference Guide].

* `_attr-value_`
+
is a character string that specifies an attribute value. You must specify _attr-value_ as a quoted string—even
if the value is a number.

* `RESET`

specifies that the attribute that you set by using a CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement in the current session is
to be reset to the value or values in effect at the start of the current session.

<<<
[[control_query_default_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT

[[control_query_default_scope]]
==== Scope of CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT

The result of the execution of a CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statement stays in effect until the current process
terminates or until the execution of another statement for the same attribute overrides it.

CQDs are applied at compile time, so CQDs do not affect any statements that are already prepared. For example:

```
PREPARE x FROM SELECT * FROM t;
CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT SCHEMA 'myschema';
EXECUTE x;                              -- uses the default schema SEABASE
SELECT * FROM t2;                       -- uses MYSCHEMA;
PREPARE y FROM SELECT * FROM t3;
CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT SCHEMA 'seabase';
EXECUTE y;                              -- uses MYSCHEMA;
```

[[control_query_default_examples]]
=== Examples of CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT

* This example changes the maximum degree of parallelism to 2 for a query. The value must be less than the number of CPUs in the cluster.
+
```
SQL>CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT PARALLEL_NUM_ESPS '2';

--- SQL operation complete.
```
+
This example resets the `PARALLEL_NUM_ESPS` attribute to its system value in the current process.
In this case, the compiler calculates the number of ESPs to be used.
+
```
SQL>CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT PARALLEL_NUM_ESPS 'system';

--- SQL operation complete.
```

* This example allows the optimizer to generate an execution using hash join.
+
```
SQL>CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT HASH_JOIN 'ON';

--- SQL operation complete.
```

* `external name '_method-name_'`
+
specifies the case-sensitive name of the external function’s method.

* `library _[[catalog-name.]schema-name.]library-name_`

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are creating the function in a shared schema, and you have the USAGE (or ALL) privilege on the library that

[[create_index_statement]]
== CREATE INDEX Statement

The CREATE INDEX statement creates an SQL index based on one or more columns of a table or table-like object.

CREATE INDEX is a Trafodion SQL extension.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run this statement
inside a user-defined transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run this statement,
AUTOCOMMIT must be turned ON (the default) for the session.

  POPULATE
| NO POPULATE

hbase-options-list is:
   hbase-option = 'value'[, hbase-option = 'value']...
```

[[create_index_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE INDEX
* `VOLATILE`
+
The CREATE VOLATILE INDEX statement creates an SQL index with a lifespan that is limited to the SQL session that the index is created. Volatile indexes are dropped automatically when the session ends. See <<indexes,Indexes>>.

* `UNIQUE`
+
The CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement creates a unique index on a table and enforces uniqueness for the indexed field, that is, it imposes the restriction that any duplicate column values are disallowed and must be eliminated before creating a unique index on a column. 

+
Unique index not only improves the query performance, but also provides data integrity checking. The constraint is checked when rows of the table are inserted or updated.

+
NOTE: Multiple NULL values are treated as duplicate values for a column which can contain only one NULL value.

* `_index-name_`
+
is an SQL identifier that specifies the simple name for the new index. You cannot qualify _index_ with its schema
name. Indexes have their own name space within a schema, so an index name might be the same as a table or constraint
name. However, no two indexes in a schema can have the same name.

* `_table_`
+
is the name of the table for which to create the index. See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `_column-name_ [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]] [,_column-name_ [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]]&#8230;`
+
specifies the columns in _table_ to include in the index. The order of the columns in the index need not correspond
to the order of the columns in the table.
+
ASCENDING or DESCENDING specifies the storage and retrieval order for rows in the index. The default is ASCENDING.
+
Rows are ordered by values in the first column specified for the index. If multiple index rows share the same value
for the first column, the values in the second column are used to order the rows, and so forth. If duplicate index
rows occur in a non-unique index, their order is based on the sequence specified for the columns of the key of the
underlying table. For ordering (but not for other purposes), nulls are greater than other values.

* `populate-option`

** `NO POPULATE`
+
specifies that the index is not to be populated when it is created. 
+
The index’s partition(s) are created, but no data is written to the index, and it is marked “offline”. You can drop an offline index with the DROP INDEX statement. 
The DROP TABLE statement also drops offline indexes of the specified table. 
DML statements have no effect on offline indexes. 
+
If an index is created with the intention of using it for a constraint, it must be populated before creating the constraint. 
You can populate an offline index and remove its offline designation by using the POPULATE INDEX utility.

** `POPULATE`
+
specifies that the index is to be created and populated. 
+
The default is `POPULATE`.

* `HBASE_OPTIONS (_hbase-option_ = '_value_'[, _hbase-option_ = '_value_']&#8230;)`
+
a list of HBase options to set for the index. These options are applied independently of any HBase options set for
the index’s table.
 
** `_hbase-option_ = '_value_'`
+
is one of these HBase options and its assigned value:
+
[options="header"]

`SALT USING _num_ PARTITIONS [ON (_column_[, _column_]&#8230;)])` as its base table.

<<<
[[create_index_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CREATE INDEX

Indexes are created under a single transaction. When an index is created, the following steps occur:

* Transaction begins (either a user-started transaction or a system-started transaction).
* Rows are written to the metadata.
* Physical labels are created to hold the index (as non audited).
* The base table is locked for read shared access which prevents inserts, updates, and deletes on the base table from occurring.
* The index is loaded by reading the base table for read uncommitted access using side tree inserts.
+
NOTE: A side tree insert is a fast way of loading data that can perform specialized optimizations because the
partitions are not audited and empty.

* After load is complete, the index audit attribute is turned on and it is attached to the base table (to bring the index on-line).
* The transaction is committed, either by the system or later by the requester.

If the operation fails after basic semantic checks are performed, the index no longer exists and the entire transaction
is rolled back even if it is a user-started transaction.

If you are creating an index on a large Trafodion table that is already populated, 
you should use the NO POPULATE option, and then run the POPULATE INDEX utility to load the index. 
Because CREATE INDEX executes in a single transaction, it could experience transactional limitations such as a transaction timeout 
if a large amount of data is to be moved.

[[create_index_authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

An index always has the same security as the table it indexes.

CREATE INDEX locks out INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations on the table being indexed. If other processes have rows in the table locked
when the operation begins, CREATE INDEX waits until its lock request is granted or timeout occurs.

You cannot access an index directly.

<<<
[[create_index_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a CREATE INDEX statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are creating the table in a shared schema.
* You are the private schema owner.
* You are the owner of the table.
* You have the ALTER, ALTER_TABLE, CREATE, or CREATE_INDEX component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
+
NOTE: In this case, if you create an index in a private schema, it will be owned by the schema owner.

[[create_index_limits]]
==== Limits on Indexes

For non-unique indexes, the sum of the lengths of the columns in the index plus the sum of the length of
the clustering key of the underlying table cannot exceed 2048 bytes.

No restriction exists on the number of indexes per table.

[[create_index_examples]]
=== Examples of CREATE INDEX

* This example creates an index on two columns of a table:
+
```
CREATE INDEX xempname

[[create_library_statement]]
== CREATE LIBRARY Statement

The CREATE LIBRARY statement registers a library object in a {project-name} database. A library object
can be an SPJ's JAR file or a UDF's library file.

CREATE LIBRARY is a {project-name} SQL extension.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run
this statement inside a user-defined transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT
is OFF. To run this statement, AUTOCOMMIT must be turned ON (the default) for the session.

```

   [local file 'host-filename']
```

[[create_library_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE LIBRARY

* `_[[catalog-name.]schema-name.]library-name_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of the library object, where each part of the name is a valid sql
identifier with a maximum of 128 characters. specify a name that is unique and does not exist for
libraries in the same schema. if you do not fully qualify the library name, trafodion sq qualifies
it according to the schema of the current session. for more information, see <<identifiers,identifiers>>
and <<database_object_names,database object names>>.

<<<
* `file '_library-filename_'`
+
specifies the full path of a deployed library file, which either an SPJ's jar file or a UDF's library file.
+
NOTE: Make sure to upload the library file to the trafodion cluster and then copy the library file to the
same directory on all the nodes in the cluster before running the create library statement. otherwise, you
will see an error message indicating that the jar or dll file was not found.

* `host name '_host-name_'`
+
specifies the name of the client host machine where the deployed file resides.

* `local file '_host-filename_'`
+
specifies the path on the client host machine where the deployed file is stored.

[[create_library_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CREATE LIBRARY

* A library object cannot refer to a library file referenced by another library object. If the _library-filename_
is in use by another library object, the CREATE LIBRARY command will fail.
* The _library-filename_ must specify an existing file. Otherwise, the CREATE LIBRARY command will fail.
* The CREATE LIBRARY command does not verify that the specified _library-filename_ is a valid executable file.
* HOST NAME and LOCAL FILE are position dependent.

[[create_procedure_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE PROCEDURE

* `_procedure-ref_([_sql-parameter_[, _sql-parameter_]&#8230;])`
+
specifies the name of the stored procedure in Java (SPJ) and any SQL parameters that correspond to the signature of
the SPJ method.

** `_procedure-ref_`
+
specifies an ANSI logical name of the form:
+
`_[[catalog-name.]schema-name.]procedure-name_`
+
where each part of the name is a valid SQL identifier with a maximum of 128 characters. For more information,
see <<identifiers,identifiers>> and <<database_object_names,database object names>>.
+
specify a name that is unique and does not exist for any procedure or function in the same schema. {project-name}
does not support the overloading of procedure names. That is, you cannot register the same procedure name more than
once with different underlying SPJ methods.
+
If you do not fully qualify the procedure name, then {project-name} qualifies it according to the schema of the current session.

** `_sql-parameter_`
+
specifies an SQL parameter that corresponds to the signature of the SPJ method:
+
`[_parameter-mode_] [_sql-identifier_] _sql-datatype_`

*** `_parameter-mode_`
+
specifies the mode `in`, `out`, or `inout` of a parameter. The default is `in`.

**** `in`
+
specifies a parameter that passes data to an SPJ.

**** `out`
+
specifies a parameter that accepts data from an SPJ. The parameter must be an array.

**** `inout`
+
specifies a parameter that passes data to and accepts data from an SPJ. The parameter must be an array.

*** `_sql-identifier_`
+
specifies an SQL identifier for the parameter. For more information, see <<identifiers,identifiers>>.

*** `_sql-datatype_`
+
specifies an SQL data type that corresponds to the Java parameter of the SPJ method.
+
_sql-datatype_ can be:

1. the trafodion database stores pic x as a char data type.
2. numeric data types of sql parameters must be signed, which is the default in the trafodion database.
3. the trafodion database stores pic s9 as a decimal or numeric data type.
4. by default, the sql data type maps to a java primitive type. the sql data type maps to a java wrapper class
only if you specify the wrapper class in the java signature of the external name clause.
+
for more information, see <<data_types,data types>>.

* `external name '_java-method-name_ [_java-signature_]'`

** `_java-method-name_`
+
specifies the case-sensitive name of the SPJ method of the form:
+
`[_package-name_.]_class-name_._method-name_`
+
The Java method must exist in a Java class file, _class-name_.class, within a library registered in the database.
The Java method must be defined as `public` and `static` and have a return type of `void`.
+
If the class file that contains the SPJ method is part of a package, then you must also specify the package name.
If you do not specify the package name, the create procedure statement fails to register the SPJ.

** `_java-signature_`
+
specifies the signature of the SPJ method and consists of:
+
`([_java-datatype_[, _java-datatype_]&#8230;])`
+
The Java signature is necessary only if you want to specify a Java wrapper class (for example, `java.lang.Integer`) instead of a java
primitive data type (for example, `int`). An SQL data type maps to a Java primitive data type by default.
+
The Java signature is case-sensitive and must be placed within parentheses, such as `(java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Integer`).
The signature must specify each of the parameter data types in the order they appear in the Java method definition within
the class file. Each Java data type that corresponds to an out or inout parameter must be followed by empty square
brackets (`[ ]`), such as `java.lang.Integer[]`.
+
<<<
*** `_java-datatype_`
+
Specifies a mappable Java data type. For the mapping of the Java data types to SQL data types, see _sql-datatype_.

* `library _[[catalog-name.]schema-name.]library-name_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of a library containing the SPJ method. If you do not fully qualify the library name,
then {project-name} qualifies it according to the schema of the current session.

* `external security _external-security-type_`
+
determines the privileges, or rights, that users have when executing (or calling) the SPJ. An SPJ can have one of these
types of external security:

** `invoker` determines that users can execute, or invoke, the stored procedure using the privileges of the user who invokes
the stored procedure. This behavior is referred to as _invoker rights_ and is the default behavior if external security is
not specified. Invoker rights allow a user who has the execute privilege on the SPJ to call the SPJ using his or her existing
privileges. In this case, the user must be granted privileges to access the underlying database objects on which the SPJ operates.
+
NOTE: Granting a user privileges to the underlying database objects gives the user direct access to those database objects,
which could pose a risk to more sensitive or critical data to which users should not have access. For example, an SPJ
might operate on a subset of the data in an underlying database object but that database object might contain other
more sensitive or critical data to which users should not have access.

** `definer` determines that users can execute, or invoke, the stored procedure using the privileges of the user who created
the stored procedure. This behavior is referred to as _definer rights_. The advantage of definer rights is that users are
allowed to manipulate data by invoking the stored procedure without having to be granted privileges to the underlying
database objects. That way, users are restricted from directly accessing or manipulating more sensitive or critical data in
the database. However, be careful about the users to whom you grant execute privilege on an SPJ with definer external security
because those users will be able to execute the SPJ without requiring privileges to the underlying database objects.

<<<
* `LANGUAGE java`
+
specifies that the external user-defined routine is written in the java language.

* `parameter style java`
+
specifies that the run-time conventions for arguments passed to the external user-defined routine are those of the Java language.

* `no sql`
+
specifies that the SPJ cannot perform SQL operations.

* `contains sql | modifies sql data | reads sql data`
+
specifies that the SPJ can perform SQL operations. All these options behave the same as `contains sql`, meaning that the SPJ
can read and modify SQL data. Use one of these options to register a method that contains SQL statements. Ff you do not specify
an SQL access mode, then the default is `contains sql`.

* `dynamic result sets _integer_`
+
specifies the maximum number of result sets that the SPJ can return. This option is applicable only if the method signature
contains a `java.sql.resultset[]` object. If the method contains a result set object, then the valid range is 1 to 255 inclusive.
The actual number of result sets returned by the SPJ method can be fewer than or equal to this number. If you do not specify
this option, then the default value is 0 (zero), meaning that the SPJ does not return result sets.

* `TRANSACTION REQUIRED | NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED`
+
determines whether the SPJ must run in a transaction inherited from the calling application (`TRANSACTION REQUIRED`, the default
option) or whether the SPJ runs without inheriting the calling application’s transaction (`NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED`). Typically,
you want the stored procedure to inherit the transaction from the calling application. However, if the SPJ method does
not access the database or if you want the stored procedure to manage its own transactions, then you should set the stored
procedure’s transaction attribute to `NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED`. For more information, see
<<effects_of_the_transaction_attribute_on_spjs,effects of the transaction attribute on SPJs>>.

<<<
* `DETERMINISTIC | NOT DETERMINISTIC`
+
specifies whether the SPJ always returns the same values for out and inout parameters for a given set of argument values
(`DETERMINISTIC`) or does not return the same values (`NOT DETERMINISTIC`, the default option). If you specify `DETERMINISTIC`,
{project-name} is not required to call the SPJ each time to produce results; instead, {project-name} caches the results and
reuses them during subsequent calls, thus optimizing the CALL statement.

* `NO ISOLATE | ISOLATE`
+
specifies that the SPJ executes either in the environment of the database server (`NO ISOLATE`) or in an isolated environment
(`ISOLATE`, the default option). {project-name} allows both options but always executes the SPJ in the UDR server process (`ISOLATE`).

no active transaction. In this case, you should not use transaction control statements (or equivalent JDBC transaction methods)
in the SPJ method. Transaction control statements include COMMIT WORK and ROLLBACK WORK, and the equivalent JDBC transaction
methods are `Connection.commit()` and `Connection.rollback()`. If you try to use transaction control statements or methods in an
SPJ method when the stored procedure’s transaction attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED, then the transaction control statements
or methods in the SPJ method are ignored, and the Java virtual machine (JVM) does not report any errors or warnings. When the
stored procedure’s transaction attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED, then you should rely on the transaction control statements
or methods in the application that calls the stored procedure and allow the calling application to manage the transactions.

_Committing or Rolling Back a Transaction_

If you do not use transaction control statements in the calling application, then the transaction initiated by the CALL statement
might not automatically commit or roll back changes to the database. When AUTOCOMMIT is ON (the default setting), the database
engine automatically commits or rolls back any changes made to the database at the end of the CALL statement execution. However,
when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF, the current transaction remains active until the end of the client session or until you explicitly commit
or roll back the transaction. To ensure an atomic unit of work when calling an SPJ, use the COMMIT WORK statement in the calling
application to commit the transaction when the CALL statement succeeds, and use the ROLLBACK WORK statement to roll back the
transaction when the CALL statement fails.

<<<
===== No Transaction Required

In some cases, you might not want the SPJ method to inherit the transaction from the calling application. Instead, you might want
the stored procedure to manage its own transactions or to run without a transaction. Not inheriting the calling application’s
transaction is useful in these cases:

* The stored procedure performs several long-running operations, such as multiple DDL or table maintenance operations, on the
database. In this case, you might want to commit those operations periodically from within the SPJ method to avoid locking tables
for a long time.
* The stored procedure performs certain SQL operations that must run without an active transaction. For example, INSERT, UPDATE,
and DELETE statements with the WITH NO ROLLBACK option are rejected when a transaction is already active, as is the case when a
stored procedure inherits a transaction from the calling application. The PURGEDATA utility is also rejected when a transaction
is already active.
* The stored procedure does not access the database. In this case, the stored procedure does not need to inherit the transaction
from the calling application. By setting the stored procedure’s transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED, you can avoid
the overhead of the calling application’s transaction being propagated to the stored procedure.

In these cases, you should set the stored procedure’s transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED when creating the stored
procedure.

If you specify NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED and if the SPJ method creates a JDBC default connection, that connection will have autocommit
enabled by default. You can either use the autocommit transactions or disable autocommit (conn.setAutoCommit(false);) and use the
JDBC transaction methods, `Connection.commit()` and `Connection.rollback()`, to commit or roll back work where needed.

=== Examples of CREATE PROCEDURE

* This CREATE PROCEDURE statement registers an SPJ named LOWERPRICE, which does not accept any arguments:
+
```
SET SCHEMA SALES;

CREATE PROCEDURE lowerprice()
   EXTERNAL NAME 'Sales.lowerPrice'
   LIBRARY saleslib
   LANGUAGE JAVA
   PARAMETER STYLE JAVA
   MODIFIES SQL DATA;
```
+
Because the procedure name is not qualified by a catalog and schema, {project-name} qualifies it according to the current
session settings, where the catalog is TRAFODION (by default) and the schema is set to SALES. Since the procedure needs
to be able to read and modify SQL data, MODIFIES SQL DATA is specified in the CREATE PROCEDURE statement.
+
To call this SPJ, use this CALL statement:
+
```
CALL lowerprice();
```
+
The LOWERPRICE procedure lowers the price of items with 50 or fewer orders by 10 percent in the database.

* This CREATE PROCEDURE statement registers an SPJ named TOTALPRICE, which accepts three input parameters and returns a numeric value, the
total price to an INOUT parameter:
+
```
CREATE PROCEDURE trafodion.sales.totalprice(IN qty NUMERIC (18),
                                            IN rate VARCHAR (10),
                                            INOUT price NUMERIC (18,2))
   EXTERNAL NAME 'Sales.totalPrice'
   LIBRARY sales.saleslib
   LANGUAGE JAVA
   PARAMETER STYLE JAVA
   NO SQL;
```
+
<<<
+
To call this SPJ in TrafCI, use these statements:
+
```
SET PARAM ?p 10.00;
CALL sales.totalprice(23, 'standard', ?p);

p
--------------------
              253.97

--- SQL operation complete.
```
+
Since the procedure does not read and modify any SQL data, NO SQL is specified in the CREATE PROCEDURE statement.

* This CREATE PROCEDURE statement registers an SPJ named MONTHLYORDERS, which accepts an integer value for the month
and returns the number of orders:
+
```
CREATE PROCEDURE sales.monthlyorders(IN INT, OUT number INT)
   EXTERNAL NAME 'Sales.numMonthlyOrders (int, java.lang.Integer[])'
   LIBRARY sales.saleslib
   LANGUAGE JAVA
   PARAMETER STYLE JAVA
   READS SQL DATA;
```
+
Because the OUT parameter is supposed to map to the Java wrapper class, java.lang.Integer, you must specify the Java
signature in the EXTERNAL NAME clause. To invoke this SPJ, use this CALL statement:
+
```
CALL sales.monthlyorders(3, ?);

ORDERNUM
-----------
          4

--- SQL operation complete.
```

<<<
* This CREATE PROCEDURE statement registers an SPJ named ORDERSUMMARY, which accepts a date (formatted as a string) and
returns information about the orders on or after that date.
+
```
CREATE PROCEDURE sales.ordersummary(IN on_or_after_date VARCHAR (20),
                                    OUT num_orders LARGEINT)
   EXTERNAL NAME 'Sales.orderSummary (int, long[])'
   LIBRARY sales.saleslib
   EXTERNAL SECURITY invoker
   LANGUAGE JAVA
   PARAMETER STYLE JAVA
   READS SQL DATA
   DYNAMIC RESULT SETS 2;
```
+
To invoke this SPJ, use this CALL statement:
+
```
CALL trafodion.sales.ordersummary('01-01-2014', ?);
```
+
The ORDERSUMMARY procedure returns this information about the orders on or after the specified date, 01-01-2014:

_role-name_ cannot be an existing role name, and it cannot be a registered database username. However,
_role-name_ can be a configured directory-service username.

* `WITH ADMIN _grantor_`
+
specifies a role owner other than the current user. This is an optional clause.

* `_grantor_`

specifies a registered database username to whom you assign the role owner.

<<<
[[create_role_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CREATE ROLE

* To create a role, you must either be DB ROOT or have been granted the MANAGE_ROLES component privilege for SQL_OPERATIONS.
* PUBLIC, _SYSTEM, NONE, and database user names beginning with DB are reserved. You cannot specify a _role-name_ with any such name.

[[create_role_ownership]]
==== Role Ownership

You can give role ownership to a user by specifying the user in the WITH ADMIN _grantor_ clause with the _grantor_ as the user.

The role owner can perform these operations:

* Grant and revoke the role to users.
* Drop the role.

Role ownership is permanent. After you create the role, the ownership of the role cannot be changed or assigned to another user.

[[create_schema_statement]]
== CREATE SCHEMA Statement

The CREATE SCHEMA statement creates a schema in the database. See <<Schemas,Schemas>>.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run DDL statements
inside a user-defined transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run these statements,
AUTOCOMMIT must be turned ON (the default) for the session.

CREATE [schema-class] SCHEMA [IF NOT EXISTS] schema-clause

schema-class is:
   [ PRIVATE | SHARED ]

schema-clause is:
   { schema-name [AUTHORIZATION authid] | AUTHORIZATION authid }

```

[[create_schema_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE SCHEMA

* `_schema-class_`
+
indicates whether access to the schema is restricted to the authorization ID by default (PRIVATE) or whether
any database user may add objects to the schema (SHARED). The default class is PRIVATE.
+
NOTE: Schemas created in {project-name} Release 0.9 or earlier are SHARED schemas.

* `IF NOT EXISTS`
+
creates the schema if it does not already exist. If omitted, then an error will be raised if the schema
already exists.

* `_schema-name_`
+
is a name for the new schema and is an SQL identifier that specifies a unique name that is not currently a schema name.
This parameter is optional. However, if you do not specify a schema name, you must specify the authorization clause. If
a schema name is not provided, the authorization ID is used for the schema name. If the authorization ID name matches an
existing schema, the CREATE SCHEMA command fails.

* `_authid_`
+
is the name of the database user or role will own and administer the schema. If this clause is not present, the current
user becomes the schema owner.

[[create_schema_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CREATE SCHEMA

[[create_schema_reserved_schema_names]]
==== Reserved Schema Names

Schema names that begin with a leading underscore (_) are reserved for future use.

[[create_schema_authorization_clause]]
==== AUTHORIZATION Clause

The AUTHORIZATION clause is optional. If you omit this clause, the current user becomes the schema owner.

NOTE: An authorization ID is assigned to a schema name even if authorization is not enabled for the {project-name} database.
However, no enforcement occurs unless authorization is enabled.

The schema owner can perform operations on the schema and on objects within the schema. For example:

* Alter DDL of objects
* Drop the schema
* Drop objects
* Manage objects with utility commands such as UPDATE STATISTICS and PURGEDATA

[[create_schema_who_can_create_a_schema]]
==== Who Can Create a Schema

The privilege to create a schema is controlled by the component privilege CREATE_SCHEMA for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
By default, this privilege is granted to PUBLIC, but it can be revoked by DB ROOT.

When authorization is initialized, these authorization IDs are granted the CREATE_SCHEMA privilege:

* PUBLIC
* DB ROOT
* DB ROOTROLE

DB ROOT or anyone granted the DB_ROOTROLE role can grant the CREATE_SCHEMA privilege.

[[create_sequence_statement]]
== CREATE SEQUENCE Statement

The CREATE SEQUENCE Statement produces an automatic ascending sequence of numeric values, which can be used by multiple users as primary key values. For example, to generate only odd numbers in a sequence, you can create a sequence defined with `START WITH=1, INCREMENT BY=2`.

Multiple options can be concurrently specified and separated by a space. 

There are two expressions can be used with sequence:

* `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, CURRENT)`: get the current value which is returned from the sequence on the current session rather than the current value of the sequence. 

+
For example, a sequence object called _employee_seq_ which starts with 1 and caches up to 25 with only three users.

+
If User A calls `SEQNUM(_employee_seq_, CURRENT)`, it will return 1 and reserve from 1 to 25, and User B immediately calls `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, CURRENT)` and it will return 26 and reserve from 26 to 51, then User C immediately calls `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, CURRENT)` and it will return 51 and reserve from 51 to 75. 

+
Now, if User A immediately calls `SEQNUM(_employee_seq_, NEXT)`, it will return 2 rather than 76. 76 will be returned if User A immediately calls `SEQNUM(_employee_seq_, NEXT)` after achieving 25 where the cache for User A is exhausted.

* `SEQNUM(_employee_seq_, NEXT)`: advance the sequence and retrieve the next value. For an ascending sequence, this value is increasing.

+
NOTE: 

** It always returns the initial value of the sequence by calling `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, CURRENT)` or `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, NEXT)` for the first time.

** It returns a new incremented value of the sequence with each subsequent reference to `SEQNUM(_sequence-name_, NEXT)`.

CREATE SEQUENCE is a Trafodion SQL extension.

For more inforamation, see <<drop_sequence_statement,DROP SEQUENCE Statement>> or <<alter_sequence_statement,ALTER SEQUENCE Statement>>.

```
CREATE SEQUENCE [[catalog-name.]schema-name.]sequence-name
[START WITH integer]
[INCREMENT BY integer]
[MAXVALUE integer | NO MAXVALUE]
[MINVALUE integer]
[CACHE integer | NO CACHE]
[CYCLE | NO CYCLE]
[DATA TYPE]
```
By default, it is an ascending sequence that *starts with 1, increments by 1, has cache value of 25 and the
maximum value of 2^63^-2, does not cycle and belongs to LARGEINT data type*.

[[create_sequence_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE SEQUENCE

* `_[[catalog-name.]schema-name.]sequence-name_`

+
Specifies the name of the sequence to be created, with optional catalog and schema name, where each part of the name is a valid sql identifier with a maximum of 128 characters.

+
The name should be unique and does not exist for any session in the same schema. Trafodion does not support the overloading of session names. That is, you cannot register the same session name more than once.

+
If you do not fully qualify the session name, Trafodion qualifies it according to the schema of the current session. For more information, see <<identifiers,Identifiers>> and <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `START WITH`

+
Specifies the initial value. This value can only be positive, and must be greater than or equal to `MINVALUE` (if `NO CACHE` is specified) and less than `MAXVALUE`.  

+
NOTE: If the initial value is beyond the range specified by `MINVALUE` or `MAXVALUE`, an error will be raised.

+
If not specified, the `START WITH` defaults to 1. For an ascending sequence, this value is `MINVALUE`.

* `INCREMENT BY`
+
Specifies the increment value between consecutive sequence values. 

+
NOTE: This value can only be positive, so that Trafodion only supports ascending sequence. The value must be smaller than or equal to the difference between `MAXVALUE` and `MINVALUE`. 

+
If not specified, the `INCREMENT BY` defaults to 1.

* `MAXVALUE`
+
Specifies the maximum value where an ascending sequence stops generating values or cycles. The default is 2^63^-2.

+
The `MAXVALUE` of a sequence depends on the maximum value supported by the data type, and you can also specify a `MAXVALUE` within the range.

+
NOTE:

** An error is returned if `MAXVALUE` is beyond supported range, or if subsequent value is generated for an ascending sequence when the `MAXVALUE` is exceeded with `NO CYCLE` specified.

** `MAXVALUE` might not be same as the actual maximum value that the sequence generated if the `INCREAMENT BY` is a value other than 1. For example, when a sequence is specified with `START WITH 3, INCREMENT 4` and `MAXVALUE 12` will return a maximum value of 11.

* `NO MAXVALUE`
+
If `NO MAXVALUE` is specified, for an ascending sequence, the `MAXVALUE` is the value you specified or the maximum value supported by the data type.

* `MINVALUE`
+
Specifies the minimum value where an ascending sequence cycles after hitting the maximum limit. The default is 1.

+
The `MINVALUE` of a sequence depends on the minimum value supported by the data type, and you can also specify a `MINVALUE` within the range.

+
If `MINVALUE` and `START WITH` are not specified, for an ascending sequence, the `MINVALUE` defaults to 1.

* `CYCLE`
+
Specifies that the sequence exhausts its range and wraps around after reaching its `MAXVALUE`.

+
If specified, for an ascending sequence, it restarts from `MINVALUE` after reaching `MAXVALUE`. 

* `NO CYCLE`
+
Specifies that the sequence cannot cycle once the `MAXVALUE` is reached, and throws an exception when generating subsequent value if the limit is exceeded. 

+
`NO CYCLE` is the default. 

* `CACHE`
+
Specifies the range of upcoming successive values preallocated and stored in memory for speeding up future request. 

+
The default CACHE value is 25. 

+
The minimum CACHE value is 2.

+
The CACHE value must be less than or equal to the value determined by following formula: 

+
`(MAXVALUE – START WITH + 1) / INCREMENT BY`

+
The sequence cache will be repopulated when the cache is exhausted.

+
NOTE: The unused preallocated values will be lost and leave unintended gaps if unexpected shutdown occurs or the sequence object is manually restarted, Trafodion will continue to cache new values from where it left off, so that the same value will never appear twice unless `CYCLE` is specified.

* `NO CACHE`
+
Specifies the values of the sequence are not preallocated, which lowers the risk of losing values even if it might cause performance degradation. In this case, every request for a new value will be synchronously updated in the system table.

+
If both `CACHE` and `NO CACHE` are not specified, it will cache 25 values by default.

* `DATA TYPE`
+
A sequence can be specified as following data types:

+
[cols="1,1,1,options="header"]
|===
| Type   | Minimum value | Maximum value 
| SMALLINT UNSIGNED    | 1                | 2^16^-1
| INTEGER UNSIGHED     | 1                | 2^32^-1

creates an HBase table if it does not already exist when the table is created. This option does not apply to volatile tables.

* `_table_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of the table. See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>. This name must be
unique among names of tables and views within its schema.
+
TIP: Avoid using table names that begin with "TRAF_SAMPLE_", as {project-name} SQL assumes that
such tables are persistent sample tables. See also <<update_statistics_incremental_update_statistics,
Incremental Update Statistics>>.

* `SALT USING _num_ PARTITIONS [ON (_column_[, _column_]&#8230;)]`
+
pre-splits the table into multiple regions when the table is created. Salting adds a hash value of the row key as a key
prefix, thus avoiding hot spots for sequential keys. The number of partitions that you specify can be a function of the
number of region servers present in the HBase cluster. You can specify a number from 2 to 1024. If you do not specify
columns, the default is to use all primary key columns.
+
If SALT is specified with LIKE, then this specification overrides that of the _source-table_. Note:
this is a new feature in Trafodion 2.1. In earlier releases, the SALT clause is ignored if specified
with LIKE.

<<<
* `STORE BY { PRIMARY KEY | (_key-column-list_)}`
+
specifies a set of columns on which to base the clustering key. The clustering key determines the order of rows within
the physical file that holds the table. The storage order has an effect on how you can partition the object.

** `PRIMARY KEY`
+
bases the clustering key on the primary key columns.

** `_key-column-list_`
+
bases the clustering key on the columns in the _key-column-list_. The key columns in _key-column-list_ must be specified
as NOT NULL and must be the same as the primary key columns that are defined on the table. If STORE BY is not specified,
then the clustering key is the PRIMARY KEY.

* `HBASE_OPTIONS (_hbase-option_ = '_value_'[, _hbase-option_ = '_value_']&#8230;)`
+
a list of HBase options to set for the table.

** `_hbase-option_ = '_value_'`
+
is one of these HBase options and its assigned value:
+
[options="header"]

specifies a select query which is used to populate the created table. A select query can be any SQL select statement.

* `_division-expr-list_`
+
is a list of expressions that can only refer to primary key or STORE BY columns.

+
The following are allowed expressions in the DIVISON BY clause, they are monotonically increasing expressions:

** cast((exact_numeric_column[ + const1 ]) / const2 as numeric_data_type)
** DATE_PART('YEAR', date_part_arg )

<<<
* `_column data-type_`
+
specifies the name and data type for a column in the table. At least one column definition is required in a
CREATE TABLE statement.

** _column_ is an SQL identifier. _column_ must be unique among column names in the table. If the name is a {project-name}
SQL reserved word, you must delimit it by enclosing it in double quotes. Such delimited parts are case-sensitive.
For example: "join".

** _data-type_ is the data type of the values that can be stored in _column_. A default value must be of the same type as
the column, including the character set for a character column. See "Data Types" Data type also includes case specific
information, such as UPSHIFT.

* `[NOT] CASESPECIFIC`
+
specifies that the column contains strings that are not case specific. The default is CASESPECIFIC. Comparison between two
values is done in a case insensitive way only if both are case insensitive. This applies to comparison in a binary predicate,
LIKE predicate, and POSITION/REPLACE string function searches.
* `DEFAULT _default_ | NO DEFAULT`
+
specifies a default value for the column or specifies that the column does not have a default value.
See <<default_clause,DEFAULT Clause>>.

* `CONSTRAINT _constraint-name_`
+
specifies a name for the column or table constraint. _constraint-name_ must have the same schema as _table_ and must be
unique among constraint names in its schema. If you omit the schema portions of the name you specify in _constraint-name_,
{project-name} SQL expands the constraint name by using the schema for _table_. See <<constraint_names,Constraint Names>> and
<<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.


* `NOT NULL`
+
is a column constraint that specifies that the column cannot contain nulls. If you omit NOT NULL, nulls are allowed in
the column. If you specify both NOT NULL and NO DEFAULT, each row inserted in the table must include a value for the column.
See <<null,Null>>.

<<<
* `UNIQUE, or, UNIQUE (_column-list_)`
+
is a column or table constraint, respectively, that specifies that the column or set of columns cannot contain more than
one occurrence of the same value or set of values. If you omit UNIQUE, duplicate values are allowed unless the column or set of columns is the PRIMARY KEY.

** _column-list_ cannot include more than one occurrence of the same column. In addition, the set of columns that you
specify on a UNIQUE constraint cannot match the set of columns on any other UNIQUE constraint for the table or on the
PRIMARY KEY constraint for the table. All columns defined as unique must be specified as NOT NULL.
+
A UNIQUE constraint is enforced with a unique index. If there is already a unique index on _column-list_, {project-name} SQL
uses that index. If a unique index does not exist, the system creates a unique index.

* `PRIMARY KEY [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]], or, PRIMARY KEY (_key-column-list_)`
+
is a column or table constraint, respectively, that specifies a column or set of columns as the primary key for the table.
_key-column-list_ cannot include more than one occurrence of the same column.
+
ASCENDING and DESCENDING specify the direction for entries in one column within the key. The default is ASCENDING.
+
The PRIMARY KEY value in each row of the table must be unique within the table. A PRIMARY KEY defined for a set of columns
implies that the column values are unique and not null. You can specify PRIMARY KEY only once on any CREATE TABLE statement.
+
{project-name} SQL uses the primary key as the clustering key of the table to avoid creating a separate, unique index to implement
the primary key constraint.
+
A PRIMARY KEY constraint is required in {project-name} SQL.

<<<
* `CHECK (_condition_)`
+
is a constraint that specifies a condition that must be satisfied for each row in the table.
See <<search_condition,Search Condition>>.
+
You cannot refer to the CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, or CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function in a CHECK constraint, and you cannot use
subqueries in a CHECK constraint.

* `REFERENCES _ref-spec_`
+
specifies a REFERENCES column constraint. The maximum combined length of the columns for a REFERENCES constraint is 2048 bytes.
+
_ref-spec_ is:
+
`_referenced-table_ [(_column-list_)]`

** _referenced-table_ is the table referenced by the foreign key in a referential constraint. _referenced-table_ cannot be a view.
_referenced-table_ cannot be the same as _table_. _referenced-table_ corresponds to the foreign key in the _table_.

** _column-list_ specifies the column or set of columns in the _referenced-table_ that corresponds to the foreign key in _table_.
The columns in the column list associated with REFERENCES must be in the same order as the columns in the column list associated
with FOREIGN KEY. If _column-list_ is omitted, the referenced table's PRIMARY KEY columns are the referenced columns.
+
A table can have an unlimited number of referential constraints, and you can specify the same foreign key in more than one
referential constraint, but you must define each referential constraint separately. You cannot create self-referencing foreign
key constraints.

* `FOREIGN KEY (_column-list_) REFERENCES _ref-spec_`
+
is a table constraint that specifies a referential constraint for the table, declaring that a column or set of columns (called
a foreign key) in _table_ can contain only values that match those in a column or set of columns in the table specified in the
REFERENCES clause.
+
The two columns or sets of columns must have the same characteristics (data type, length, scale, precision). Without the FOREIGN
KEY clause, the foreign key in _table_ is the column being defined; with the FOREIGN KEY clause, the foreign key is the column or
set of columns specified in the FOREIGN KEY clause. For information about _ref-spec_, see REFERENCES _ref-spec_.

<<<
* `LIKE _source-table_ [_include-option_]&#8230;`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to create a table like the existing table, _source-table_, omitting constraints (with the exception of the NOT
NULL and PRIMARY KEY constraints) and partitions unless the _include-option_ clauses are specified.

** `_source-table_`
+
is the ANSI logical name for the existing table and must be unique among names of tables and views within its schema.

** `_include-option_`

*** `WITH CONSTRAINTS`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to use constraints from _source-table_. Constraint names for _table_ are randomly generated unique names.
+
When you perform a CREATE TABLE LIKE, whether or not you include the WITH CONSTRAINTS clause, the target table will have all
the NOT NULL column constraints that exist for the source table with different constraint names.

*** `WITHOUT DIVISION`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to not use divisioning from _source-table_. If this clause is omitted, then 
the _table_ will have the same divisioning as the _source-table_.

*** `WITHOUT LOB COLUMNS`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to not include LOB columns from the _source-table_. If this clause is omitted, then 
the _table_ will have the same LOB columns as the _source-table_.

*** `WITHOUT SALT`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to not use salting for _table_. If this clause is omitted,
and no SALT clause is specified,
the _table_ will have the same divisioning as the _source-table_.
+
This option cannot be specified if a SALT clause is also specified.

=== Considerations for CREATE TABLE

The following subsections provide considerations for various CREATE TABLE options:

[[create_table_authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

[[create_table_required_privileges]]
===== Required Privileges

To issue a CREATE TABLE statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are creating the table in a shared schema.
* You are the private schema owner.
* You have the CREATE or CREATE_TABLE component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.

NOTE: In this case, if you create a table in a private schema, it will be owned by the schema owner.

<<<
[[create_table_privileges_needed_to_create_a_referential_integrity_constraint]]
===== Privileges Needed to Create a Referential Integrity Constraint

To create a referential integrity constraint (that is, a constraint on he table that refers to a column in another table),
one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the referencing and referenced tables.
* You have these privileges on the referencing and referenced table:
** For the referencing table, you have the CREATE or CREATE_TABLE component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
** For the referenced table, you have the REFERENCES (or ALL) privilege on the referenced table through your username
or through a granted role.

If the constraint refers to the other table in a query expression, you must also have SELECT privileges on the other table.


[[create_volatile_table_considerations]]
==== Considerations for CREATE VOLATILE TABLE

* Volatile temporary tables are closely linked to the session. Their name space is unique across multiple concurrent
sessions, and therefore allow multiple sessions to use the same volatile temporary table names simultaneously without
any conflicts.
* Volatile tables support creation of indexes. Volatile index can be created only on volatile table.
* Volatile tables are partitioned by the system. The number of partitions is limited to four partitions by default.
The partitions will be distributed across the cluster. The default value is four partitions regardless of the system
configuration.
* UPDATE STATISTICS is not supported for volatile tables. If you need statistics, you must use a non-volatile table instead.
* Volatile tables can be created and accessed using one-part, two-part, or three-part names. However, you must use the
same name (one part, two part, or three part) for any further DDL or DML statements on the created volatile table.
See <<create_table_examples,Examples of CREATE TABLE>>.
* {project-name} SQL allows users to explicitly specify primary key and STORE BY clauses on columns that contain null values.

<<<
* {project-name} SQL does not require that the first column in a volatile table contain not null values and be the primary key.
Instead, {project-name} SQL attempts to partition the table, if possible, using an appropriate suitable key column as the
primary and partitioning key. For more information,
see <<create_table_how_trafodion_sql_selects_suitable_keys_for_volatile_tables,
How {project-name} SQL Selects Suitable Keys for Volatile Tables>>.

[[create_table_restrictions_for_create_volatile_table]]
===== Restrictions for CREATE VOLATILE TABLE

These items are not supported for volatile tables:

* ALTER statement
* User constraints
* Creating views
* Creating non-volatile indexes on a volatile table or a volatile index on a non-volatile table
* CREATE TABLE LIKE operations

[[create_table_how_trafodion_sql_supports_nullable_keys_for_volatile_tables]]
===== How {project-name} SQL Supports Nullable Keys for Volatile Tables

* Allows nullable keys in primary key, STORE BY, and unique constraints.
* A null value is treated as the highest value for that column.
* A null value as equal to other null values and only one value is allowed for that column.

[[create_table_how_trafodion_sql_selects_suitable_keys_for_volatile_tables]]
===== How {project-name} SQL Selects Suitable Keys for Volatile Tables

{project-name} SQL searches for the first suitable column in the list of columns of the table being created. Once the column
is located, the table is partitioned on it. The searched columns in the table might be explicitly specified (as in a
CREATE TABLE statement) or implicitly created (as in a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement).

The suitable key column is selected only if no primary key or STORE BY clause has been specified in the statement. If any
of these clauses have been specified, they are used to select the key columns.

<<<
{project-name} SQL follows these guidelines to search for and select suitable keys:

* A suitable column can be a nullable column.
* Certain data types in {project-name} SQL cannot be used as a partitioning key. Currently, this includes any floating point
columns (REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, and FLOAT).
* {project-name} SQL searches for a suitable column according to this predefined order:
** Numeric columns are chosen first, followed by fixed CHAR, DATETIME, INTERVAL, and VARCHAR data types.
** Within numeric data types, the order is binary NUMERIC (LARGEINT, INTEGER, SMALLINT), and DECIMAL.
** An unsigned column is given preference over a signed column.
** A non-nullable column is given preference over a nullable column.
** If all data types are the same, the first column is selected.
* If a suitable column is not located, the volatile table becomes a non-partitioned table with a system-defined SYSKEY as its primary key.
* If a suitable column is located, it becomes the partitioning key where the primary key is _suitable_column_, SYSKEY.
This causes the table to be partitioned while preventing the duplicate key and null-to-non-null errors.

The list below shows the order of precedence, from low to high, of data types when {project-name} SQL searches for a suitable
key. A data type appearing later has precedence over previously-appearing data types. Data types that do not appear in
the list below cannot be chosen as a key column.

<<<
Precedence of Data Types (From Low to High): 

* VARCHAR
* INTERVAL
* DATETIME
* CHAR(ACTER)
* DECIMAL (signed, unsigned)
* SMALLINT (signed, unsigned)
* INTEGER (signed,unsigned)
* LARGEINT (signed only)

[[create_table_creating_nullable_constraints_in_a_volatile_table]]
===== Creating Nullable Constraints in a Volatile Table

These examples show the creation of nullable constraints (primary key, STORE BY, and unique) in a volatile table:

```
create volatile table t (a int, primary key(a));
create volatile table t (a int, store by primary key);
create volatile table t (a int unique);

```
>>create volatile table t (a int, primary key(a));

--- SQL operation complete.

<<<
Only one unique null value is allowed:
```
>>insert into t values (null);

--- 1 row(s) inserted.

>>insert into t values (null);

*** ERROR[8102] The operation is prevented by a unique constraint.

--- 0 row(s) inserted.
```

[[create_table_examples_for_selecting_suitable_keys_for_volatile_tables]]
===== Examples for Selecting Suitable Keys for Volatile Tables

<<create_table_how_trafodion_sql_selects_suitable_keys_for_volatile_tables,
How {project-name} SQL Selects Suitable Keys for Volatile Tables>>:

* Selects column a as the primary and partitioning key:
+
```
create volatile table t (a int);
```

* Selects column b because int has a higher precedence than char:
+
```
create volatile table t (a char(10), b int);
```

* Selects column b because not null has precedence over nullable columns:
+
```
create volatile table t (a int, b int not null);
```

* Selects column b because int has precedence over decimal:
+
```
create volatile table t (a decimal(10), b int);
```

* Selects the first column, a, because both columns have the same data type:
+
```
create volatile table t (a int not null, b int not null);
```

<<<
* Selects column b because char has precedence over date:
+
```
create volatile table t (a date, b char(10));
```

* Selects column b because the real data type is not part of the columns to be examined:
+
```
create volatile table t (a real, b date);
```

* Does not select any column as the primary/partitioning key. SYSKEY is used automatically.
+
```
create volatile table t (a real, b double precision not null);
```
Similar examples would be used for CREATE TABLE AS SELECT queries.

[[create_table_considerations_for_create_table_like]]
==== Considerations for CREATE TABLE &#8230; LIKE

The CREATE TABLE LIKE statement does not create views, owner information, or privileges for the new table based on the
source table. Privileges associated with a new table created by using the LIKE specification are defined as if the new
table is created explicitly by the current user.

[[create_table_like_and_file_attributes]]
===== CREATE TABLE &#8230; LIKE and File Attributes

CREATE TABLE &#8230; LIKE creates a table like another table, with the exception of file attributes. File attributes
include COMPRESSION, and so on. If you do not include the attribute value as part of the CREATE TABLE &#8230; LIKE
command, SQL creates the table with the default value for the attributes and not the value from the source object.
For example, to create a table like another table that specifies compression, you must specify the compression attribute
value as part of the CREATE TABLE&#8230; LIKE statement. In the following example, the original CREATE TABLE statement
creates a table without compression. However, in the CREATE TABLE &#8230; LIKE statement, compression is specified.

```
-- Original Table create table NPTEST

(FIRST_NAME CHAR(12) CHARACTER SET ISO88591 COLLATE DEFAULT NO DEFAULT NOT NULL
, LAST_NAME CHAR(24) CHARACTER SET ISO88591 COLLATE DEFAULT NO DEFAULT NOT NULL
, ADDRESS CHAR(128) CHARACTER SET ISO88591 COLLATE DEFAULT DEFAULT NULL
, ZIP INT DEFAULT 0
, PHONE CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET ISO88591 COLLATE DEFAULT DEFAULT NULL
, SSN LARGEINT NO DEFAULT NOT NULL
, INFO1 CHAR(128) CHARACTER SET ISO88591 COLLATE DEFAULT DEFAULT NULL
, INFO2 CHAR(128) CHARACTER SET ISO88591 COLLATE DEFAULT DEFAULT NULL
, primary key (SSN,first_name,last_name)
)

max table size 512

-- CREATE TABLE LIKE

create table LSCE002 like NPTEST ATTRIBUTE compression type hardware;
```

[[create_table_considerations_for_create_table_as]]
==== Considerations for CREATE TABLE AS

These considerations apply to CREATE TABLE AS:

* Access to the table built by CREATE TABLE AS will be a full table scan because a primary and clustering key cannot
be easily defined.
* Compile time estimates and runtime information is not generated for CREATE TABLE AS tables.
* You cannot manage CREATE TABLE AS tables using WMS compile time or runtime rules.
* You cannot specify a primary key for a CREATE TABLE AS table without explicitly defining all the columns in the
CREATE TABLE statement.
* You cannot generate an explain plan for a CREATE TABLE AS &#8230;INSERT/SELECT statement. You can, however, use the
EXPLAIN plan for a CREATE TABLE AS &#8230; INSERT/SELECT statement if you use the NO LOAD option.
* You cannot use the ORDER BY clause in a CREATE TABLE AS statement. The compiler transparently orders the selected
rows to improve the efficiency of the insert.

[[create_table_considerations_for_load_if_exists_and_no_load_options_of_create_table_as]]
===== Considerations for LOAD IF EXISTS and NO LOAD options of CREATE TABLE AS

The LOAD IF EXISTS option in a CREATE TABLE AS statement causes data to be loaded into an existing table. If you do not
specify the LOAD IF EXISTS option and try to load data into an existing table, the CREATE TABLE AS statement fails to
execute. Use the LOAD IF EXISTS option with the AS clause in these scenarios:

* Running CREATE TABLE AS without re-creating the table. The table must be empty. Otherwise, the CREATE TABLE AS statement
returns an error. Delete the data in the table by using a DELETE statement before issuing the CREATE TABLE AS statement.
* Using CREATE TABLE AS to incrementally add data to an existing table. You must start a user-defined transaction before
issuing the CREATE TABLE AS statement. If you try to execute the CREATE TABLE AS statement without starting a user-defined
transaction, an error is returned, stating that data already exists in the table. With a user-defined transaction, newly
added rows are rolled back if an error occurs.

The NO LOAD option in a CREATE TABLE AS statement creates a table with the CREATE TABLE AS statement, but does not load data
into the table. The option is useful if you must create a table to review its structure and to analyze the SELECT part of the
CREATE TABLE AS statement with the EXPLAIN statement. You can also use EXPLAIN to analyze the implicated INSERT/SELECT part of
the CREATE TABLE AS &#8230; NO LOAD statement. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE ttgt NO LOAD AS (SELECT ...);
```

=== {project-name} SQL Extensions to CREATE TABLE

This statement is supported for compliance with ANSI SQL:1999 Entry Level. {project-name} SQL extensions to the CREATE TABLE
statement are ASCENDING, DESCENDING, and PARTITION clauses. CREATE TABLE LIKE is also an extension.

==== Examples of CREATE TABLE 

* This example creates a table. The clustering key is the primary key.
+
```
CREATE TABLE SALES.ODETAIL
( ordernum NUMERIC (6) UNSIGNED NO DEFAULT NOT NULL, partnum NUMERIC (4)
UNSIGNED NO DEFAULT NOT NULL, unit_price NUMERIC (8,2) NO DEFAULT NOT
NULL, qty_ordered NUMERIC (5) UNSIGNED NO DEFAULT NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (ordernum, partnum) );
```

* This example creates a table like the JOB table with the same constraints:
+
```
CREATE TABLE PERSNL.JOB_CORPORATE LIKE PERSNL.JOB WITH CONSTRAINTS;
```

* This is an example of NOT CASESPECIFIC usage:
+
```
CREATE TABLE T (a char(10) NOT CASESPECIFIC, b char(10));
INSERT INTO T values ('a', 'A');
```

* A row is not returned in this example. Constant ‘A’ is case sensitive, whereas column ‘a’ is insensitive.
+
```
SELECT * FROM T WHERE a = 'A';
```

* The row is returned in this example. Both sides are case sensitive.
+
```
SELECT * FROM T WHERE a = 'A' (not casespecific);
```

* The row is returned in this example. A case sensitive comparison is done because column ‘b’ is case sensitive.
+
```
SELECT * FROM T WHERE b = 'A';
```

* The row is returned in this example. A case sensitive comparison is done because column ‘b’ is case sensitive.
+
```
SELECT * FROM T WHERE b = 'A' (not casespecific);
```

* This is the first example of DIVISION BY usage.
+
```
CREATE TABLE call_home_data
(id LARGEINT NOT NULL,
ts TIMESTAMP(6) NOT NULL,
device_status VARCHAR(200),
PRIMARY KEY (id, ts))
SALT USING 16 PARTITIONS ON (id)
DIVISION BY (date_trunc('day', ts));
```

* This is the second example of DIVISION BY usage.
+
```
CREATE TABLE sales1
(store_id INT NOT NULL,
item_id  INT NOT NULL,
sale_date DATE DEFAULT DATE '2000-01-01' NOT NULL,
sale_amt NUMERIC(10,2),
PRIMARY KEY (store_id, item_id, sale_date))
DIVISION BY (DATEDIFF(YEAR, '2017-11-02', sale_date));
```

* This is the third example of DIVISION BY usage.
+
```
CREATE TABLE sales2
(store_id INT NOT NULL,
item_id  INT NOT NULL,
sale_date DATE DEFAULT DATE '2000-01-01' NOT NULL,
sale_amt NUMERIC(10,2),
chcol CHAR(20) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (store_id, item_id, sale_date, chcol))
DIVISION BY (SUBSTR(chcol, 1, 5)); 
```

* This example creates a table using varchar2 data type which is same as varchar.

[[create_table_examples_create_table_as]]
==== Examples of CREATE TABLE AS

This section shows the column attribute rules used to generate and specify the column names and data types of the table
being created.

* If _column-attributes_ are not specified, the select list items of the select-query are used to generate the column
names and data attributes of the created table. If the select list item is a column, then it is used as the name of the
created column. For example:
+
```
create table t as select a,b from t1
```
+
Table t has 2 columns named (a,b) and the same data attributes as columns from table t1.

* If the select list item is an expression, it must be renamed with an AS clause. An error is returned if expressions are
not named. For example:
+
```
create table t as select a+1 as c from t1
```
+
Table t has 1 column named (c) and data attribute of (a+1)
+
```
create table t as select a+1 from t1
```
+
An error is returned, expression must be renamed.

* If _column-attributes_ are specified and contains _datatype-info_, then they override the attributes of the select items
in the select query. These data attributes must be compatible with the corresponding data attributes of the select list items
in the select-query.
+
```
create table t(a int) as select b from t1
```
+
Table t has one column named "a" with data type "int".
+
```
create table t(a char(10)) as select a+1 b from t1;
```
+
An error is returned because the data attribute of column "a", a char, does not match the data attribute of the select list
item "b" a numeric.

* If _column-attributes_ are specified and they only contain _column-name_, then the specified column-name override any name
that was derived from the select query.
+
```
create table t(c,d) as select a,b from t1
```
+
Table t has 2 columns, c and d, which has the data attributes of columns a and b from table t1.

* If _column-attributes_ are specified, then they must contain attributes corresponding to all select list items in the
_select-query_. An error is returned, if a mismatch exists.
+
```
create table t(a int) as select b,c from t1
```
+
An error is returned. Two items need to be specified as part of the table-attributes.

* The _column-attributes_ must specify either the _column-name datatype-info_ pair or just the _column-name_ for all
columns. You cannot specify some columns with just the name and others with name and data type.
+
```
create table t(a int, b) as select c,d from t1
```
+
An error is returned.

* In the following example, table t1 is created. Table t2 is created using the CREATE TABLE AS syntax without table attributes:

+
```
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 int not null primary key, c2 char(50));

CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 int, c2 char (50) UPSHIFT NOT NULL) AS SELECT * FROM t1;

This example compares the execution time of using external table and not using external table when reading hive tables.

The former takes less time than the latter, since the trafodion external table supplies upper bounds for varchar lengths, which may lead to better plans and/or run-time behavior.

TIP: Either running UPDATE STATISTICS or using a trafodion external table may improve performance. To get full performance benefit, you must run UPDATE STATISTICS and use the trafodion external table.

[[create_view_statement]]
== CREATE VIEW Statement

The CREATE VIEW statement creates a {project-name} SQL view. See <<views,Views>>.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run this statement inside
a user-defined transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run this statement, AUTOCOMMIT
must be turned ON (the default) for the session.

```
CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view
    [(column-name ] [,column-name ...)]
        AS query-expr [order-by-clause]
    [WITH CHECK OPTION]
```

[[create_view_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of CREATE VIEW

* `OR REPLACE`
+
creates a view if one does not exist or replaces a view if a view of the same name exists. The view being replaced might
have the same view definition or a different view definition.

* `_view_`
+
specifies the ANSI logical name of the view. See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>. This name must be unique
among names of tables and views within its schema.

* `(_column-name_ [,_column-name_ ]&#8230;)`
+
specifies names for the columns of the view. Column names in the list must match one-for-one with columns in the table
specified by _query-expr_.
+
<<<
+
If you omit this clause, columns in the view have the same names as the corresponding columns in _query-expr_. You must
specify this clause if any two columns in the table specified by _query-expr_ have the same name or if any column of that
table does not have a name. For example, this query expression SELECT MAX(salary), AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM
employee the first column does not have a name.
+
No two columns of the view can have the same name; if a view refers to more than one table and the select list refers to
columns from different tables with the same name, you must specify new names for columns that would otherwise have duplicate
names.

* `AS _query-expr_`
+
specifies the columns for the view and sets the selection criteria that determines the rows that make up the view. For
information about character string literals, see <<character_string_literals,Character String Literals>>.
For the syntax and syntax description of _query-expr_, see <<select_statement,SELECT Statement>>. The CREATE VIEW statement
provides this restriction with regard to the _query-expr_ syntax: [ANY_N_], [FIRST _N_] select list items are not allowed
in a view.

* `_order-by-clause_`
+
specifies the order in which to sort the rows of the final result table. For the syntax and syntax description of the
_order-by-clause_, see <<select_statement,SELECT Statement>>. The CREATE VIEW statement restricts the _order-by-clause_
with regard to the _access-clause_ and _mode-clause_. The _access-mode_ and _mode-clause_ cannot follow the
_order-by-clause_.

* `WITH CHECK OPTION`
+
specifies that no row can be inserted or updated in the database through the view unless the row satisfies the view
definition—that is, the search condition in the WHERE clause of the query expression must evaluate to true for any
row that is inserted or updated. This option is only allowed for updatable views.
+
If you omit this option, a newly inserted row or an updated row need not satisfy the view definition, which means that
such a row can be inserted or updated in the table but does not appear in the view. This check is performed each time a
row is inserted or updated.
+
WITH CHECK OPTION does not affect the query expression; rows must always satisfy the view definition.

<<<
[[create_view_considerations]]
=== Considerations for CREATE VIEW

* If you specify CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW:
** A new view is created if a view of the same name does not exist.
** If a view of same name exists, the old view definition is dropped, and a view with a new definition is created. No check
will be done to see if the new view is identical to the view it is replacing. The CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW command will
unilaterally drop the old view definition and replace it with the new view definition.
** The privileges granted on the old view will be re-granted on the new view. If the re-grant of privileges fails, the
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW operation fails.
** When CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW replaces an existing view, any dependent views will be dropped.
* You can specify GROUP BY using ordinals to refer to the relative position within the SELECT list.
For example, GROUP BY 3, 2, 1.
* Dynamic parameters are not allowed.

[[create_view_effect_of_adding_a_column_on_view_definitions]]
==== Effect of Adding a Column on View Definitions

The addition of a column to a table has no effect on any existing view definitions or conditions included in constraint
definitions. Any implicit column references specified by SELECT * in view or constraint definitions are replaced by
explicit column references when the definition clauses are originally evaluated.

[[create_view_authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

To issue a CREATE VIEW statement, you must have SELECT privileges on the objects underlying the view or be the owner of
the objects underlying the view, and one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are creating the view in a shared schema.
* You are the private schema owner.
* You have the CREATE or CREATE_VIEW component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
+
NOTE: In this case, if you create a view in a private schema, it will be owned by the schema owner.

When you create a view on a single table, the owner of the view is automatically given all privileges WITH GRANT OPTION
on the view. However, when you create a view that spans multiple tables, the owner of the view is given only SELECT
privileges WITH GRANT OPTION. If you try to grant privileges to another user on the view other than SELECT, you will
receive a warning that you lack the grant option for that privilege.

[[create_view_updatable_and_non_updatable_views]]
==== Updatable and Non-Updatable Views

Single table views can be updatable. Multi-table views cannot be updatable.

To define an updatable view, a query expression must also meet these requirements:

* It cannot contain a JOIN, UNION, or EXCEPT clause.
* It cannot contain a GROUP BY or HAVING clause.
* It cannot directly contain the keyword DISTINCT.
* The FROM clause must refer to exactly one table or one updatable view.
* It cannot contain a WHERE clause that contains a subquery.
* The select list cannot include expressions or functions or duplicate column names.

[[create_view_order_by_clause_guidelines]]
==== ORDER BY Clause Guidelines

The ORDER BY clause can be specified in the SELECT portion of a CREATE VIEW definition. Any SELECT syntax that is valid
when the SELECT portion is specified on its own is also valid during the view definition. An ORDER BY clause can contain
either the column name from the SELECT list or from _select-list-index_.

When a DML statement is issued against the view, the rules documented in the following sections are used to apply the
ORDER BY clause.

<<<
===== When to Use ORDER BY

An ORDER BY clause is used in a view definition only when the clause is under the root of the Select query that uses that
view. If the ORDER BY clause appears in other intermediate locations or in a subquery, it is ignored.

Consider this CREATE VIEW statement:

```
create view v as select a from t order by a; select * from v x, v y;
```

Or this INSERT statement:

```
insert into t1 select * from v;
```

In these two examples, the ORDER BY clause is ignored during DML processing because the first appears as part of a
derived table and the second as a subquery selects, both created after the view expansion.

If the same query is issued using explicit derived tables instead of a view, a syntax error is returned:

```
select * from (select a from t order by a) x, (select a from t order by a) y;
```

This example returns a syntax error because an ORDER BY clause is not supported in a subquery.

The ORDER BY clause is ignored if it is part of a view and used in places where it is not supported. This is different
than returning an error when the same query was written with explicit ORDER BY clause, as is shown in the preceding examples.

===== ORDER BY in a View Definition With No Override

If the SELECT query reads from the view with no explicit ORDER BY override, the ORDER BY semantics of the view definition
are used.

In this example, the ordering column is the one specified in the CREATE VIEW statement:

```
create view v as select * from t order by a Select * from v
```

<<<
The SELECT query becomes equivalent to:

```
select * from t order by a;
```

===== ORDER BY in a View Definition With User Override

If a SELECT query contains an explicit ORDER BY clause, it overrides the ORDER BY clause specified in the view definition.

For example:

```
create view v as select a,b from t order by a; select * from v order by b;
```

In this example, order by b overrides the order by a specified in the view definition. The SELECT query becomes equivalent to:

```
select a,b from t order by b;
```

==== Nested View Definitions

In case of nested view definitions, the ORDER BY clause in the topmost view definition overrides the ORDER BY clause of any
nested view definitions.

For example:

```
create view v1 as select a,b from t1 order by a;
create view v2 as select a,b from v1 order by b;
select * from v2;
```

In this example, the ORDER BY specified in the definition of view v2 overrides the ORDER BY specified in the definition of view v1.

The SELECT query becomes equivalent to:

```
select a,b from (select a, b from t) x order by b;
```

<<<
[[create_view_examples]]
=== Examples of CREATE VIEW

* This example creates a view on a single table without a view column list:
+
```
CREATE VIEW SALES.MYVIEW1 AS
   SELECT ordernum, qty_ordered FROM SALES.ODETAIL;
```

* This example replaces the view, MYVIEW1, with a different view definition:
+
```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW SALES.MYVIEW1 AS
   SELECT ordernum, qty_ordered
   FROM SALES.ODETAIL WHERE unit_price > 100;
```

* This example creates a view with a column list:
+
```
CREATE VIEW SALES.MYVIEW2
   (v_ordernum, t_partnum) AS SELECT v.ordernum, t.partnum
FROM SALES.MYVIEW1 v, SALES.ODETAIL t;
```

* This example creates a view from two tables by using an INNER JOIN:
+
```
CREATE VIEW MYVIEW4 (v_ordernum, v_partnum) AS
   SELECT od.ordernum, p.partnum
   FROM SALES.ODETAIL OD INNER JOIN SALES.PARTS P
   ON od.partnum = p.partnum;
```

<<<
[[create_view_vertical_partition_example]]
==== Vertical Partition Example

This example creates three logical vertical partitions for a table, vp0, vp1, and vp2 and then creates a view vp to access them.

A view can be used to obtain a composite representation of a set of closely related tables. In the following example
tables vp0, vp1 and vp2 all have a key column a. This key column is known to contain identical rows for all three tables.
The three tables vp0, vp1 and vp2 also contain columns b, c and d respectively. We can create a view vp that combines
these three tables and provides the interface of columns a, b, c and d belonging to a single object.

{project-name} SQL has the ability to eliminate redundant joins in a query. Redundant joins occur when:

* Output of join contains expressions from only one of its two children
* Every row from this child will match one and only one row from the other child

Suppose tables A and B denote generic tables. To check if the rule "every row from this child will match one and only one row
from the other child" is true, {project-name} SQL uses the fact that the join of Table A with table or subquery B preserves all the
rows of A if the join predicate contains an equi-join predicate that references a key of B, and one of the following is true:
The join is a left outer join where B is the inner table. In this example, for the join between vp0 and vp1,vp0 fills the role
of table A and vp1 fills the role of table B. For the join between vp1 and vp2, vp1 fills the role of table A and vp2 fills
the role of table B.

The view vp shown in this example uses left outer joins to combine the three underlying tables. Therefore, if the select list
in a query that accesses vp does not contain column d from vp2 then the join to table vp2 in the view vp will not be performed.

```
create table vp0(a integer not null, b integer, primary key(a));
create table vp1(a integer not null, c integer, primary key(a));
create table vp2(a integer not null, d integer, primary key(a));

create view vp(a,b,c,d) as
   select vp0.a, b, c, d
   from vp0
   left outer join vp1 on vp0.a=vp1.a
   left outer join vp2 on vp0.a=vp2.a;

select a, b from vp; -- reads only vp0
select a, c from vp; -- reads vp0 and vp1
select d from vp; -- reads vp0 and vp2
```

<<<
[[delete_statement]]
== DELETE Statement

The DELETE statement is a DML statement that deletes a row or rows from a table or an updatable view. Deleting rows from
a view deletes the rows from the table on which the view is based. DELETE does not remove a table or view, even if you
delete the last row in the table or view.

{project-name} SQL provides searched DELETE—deletes rows whose selection depends on a search condition.

For the searched DELETE form, if no WHERE clause exists, all rows are deleted from the table or view.

```
Searched DELETE is:

DELETE 
[WITH NO ROLLBACK] ["["FIRST N"]"]
FROM table-name
[WHERE search-condition ]
[[for] access-option access]

access-option is:
read committed
```

[[delete_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of DELETE

* `_table-name_`
+
names the user table or view from which to delete rows. _table_ must be a base table or an updatable view. To refer to a
table or view, use the ANSI logical name. See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>.

* `WITH NO ROLLBACK`
+
performs a non-transactional delete.
+
A non-transactional delete is one that happens outside a transaction. It means that if the 
statement is interrupted, any deletes that have been done are still permanent.
+
NOTE: This option is only supported if there is no index on the table.

* `FIRST _N_`
+
specified that _N_ rows are to be deleted (assuming the table has at least _N_ rows and that
the qualification criteria specified in the WHERE clause, if any, would select at least _N_ rows).
+
You must enclose `First _N_` in square bracket ([ ]).
The quotation marks (" ") around each square brackt in the syntax diagram indicate that 
the bracket is a required character that you must type as shown (for example, `[FIRST 5]`).
Do not include quotation marks in the FIRST clause.
+
NOTE: When using this option without the `WITH NO ROLLBACK` option, and if you have a large 
_N_ (tens of thousands), break up _N_ into smaller numbers and execute the DELETE statement 
repeatedly for better performance.

* `WHERE _search-condition_`
+
specifies a search condition that selects rows to delete. Within the search condition, any columns being compared are
columns in the table or view being deleted from. See <<search_condition,Search Condition>>
+
If you do not specify a search condition, all rows in the table or view are deleted.

* `[FOR] _access-option_ ACCESS`
+
specifies the access option required for data used to evaluate the search condition.
See <<data_consistency_and_access_options,Data Consistency and Access Options>>.

** `READ COMMITTED`
+
specifies that any data used to evaluate the search condition must come from committed  rows.
+
The default access option is the isolation level of the containing transaction.

[[delete_considerations]]
=== Considerations for DELETE

[[delete_authorization_requirements]]
==== Authorization Requirements

DELETE requires authority to read and write to the table or view being deleted from and authority to read tables or views
specified in subqueries used in the search condition.

[[delete_transaction-initiation-and-termination]]
==== Transaction Initiation and Termination

The DELETE statement automatically initiates a transaction if no transaction is active. Otherwise, you can explicitly
initiate a transaction with the BEGIN WORK statement. When a transaction is started, the SQL statements execute within
that transaction until a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is encountered or an error occurs.

[[delete_isolation-levels-of-transactions-and-access-options-of-statements]]
==== Isolation Levels of Transactions and Access Options of Statements

The isolation level of an SQL transaction defines the degree to which the operations on data within that transaction
are affected by operations of concurrent transactions. When you specify access options for the DML statements within
a transaction, you override the isolation level of the containing transaction. Each statement then executes with
its individual access option.

[[delete_examples]]
=== Examples of DELETE

* Remove all rows from the JOB table:
+
```
DELETE FROM persnl.job;

--- 10 row(s) deleted.
```

* Remove from the table ORDERS any orders placed with sales representative 220 by any customer except customer number 1234:
+
```
DELETE FROM sales.orders
WHERE salesrep = 220 AND custnum <> 1234;

--- 2 row(s) deleted.
```

* Remove all suppliers not in Texas from the table PARTSUPP:
+
```
DELETE FROM invent.partsupp WHERE suppnum IN
   (SELECT suppnum FROM samdbcat.invent.supplier WHERE state <> 'TEXAS');

--- 41 row(s) deleted.
```
+
This statement achieves the same result:
+
```
DELETE FROM invent.partsupp WHERE suppnum NOT IN
   SELECT suppnum FROM samdbcat.invent.supplier WHERE state = 'TEXAS');

--- 41 row(s) deleted.
```

* This is an example of a self-referencing DELETE statement, where the table from which rows are deleted is scanned in a subquery:
+
```
delete from table1 where a in (select a from table1 where b > 200)
```

* This example executes a non-transactional delete of first 1000 rows that satisfy the
WHERE condition.
+
```
DELETE WITH NO ROLLBACK [FIRST 1000] 
FROM test 
WHERE id<30;
```

* This example shows that the option `WITH NO ROLLBACK` is only supported if there is no
index on the table.
+
```

=== Considerations for DROP ROLE

* To drop a role, you must own the role or have user administrative privileges for the role. You have user administrative
privileges for the role if you have been granted the MANAGE_ROLES component privilege. Initially, DB ROOT is the only
database user who has been granted the MANAGE_ROLES component privilege.
* Role names beginning with DB are reserved and can only be dropped by DB ROOT.
* You can determine all users to whom a role has been granted by using the SHOWDDL ROLE statement.
See the <<showddl_statement,SHOWDDL Statement>>.

<<<
==== Before You Drop a Role

Before dropping a role, follow these guidelines:

* You must revoke all privileges granted to the role.
* You must revoke the role from all users to whom it was granted.
* You must drop all schemas the role is a manager (or owner) of.

You can determine all users to whom a role has been granted with the SHOWDDL statement.
See the <<showddl_statement,SHOWDDL Statement>>.

==== Active Sessions for the User

When you revoke a role from a user, then the change in privileges is automatically propagated to and detected by
active sessions. There is no need for users to disconnect from and reconnect to a session to see the updated set of
privileges.

<<<
[[drop_role_examples]]
=== Examples of DROP ROLE

* To drop a role:
+
```
DROP ROLE clerks;
```

* To drop a role with dependent privileges:
+
```
-- User administrator creates a role:
CREATE ROLE clerks;

-- User administrator grants privileges on a table to the role:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE invent.partloc TO clerks;

-- User administrator grants the role to a user:
GRANT ROLE clerks TO JSmith;

-- JSmith creates a view based upon the granted privilege:
CREATE VIEW invent.partlocView (partnum, loc_code)
AS SELECT partnum, loc_code FROM invent.partloc;

-- If the user administrator attempts to drop the role, this
-- would fail because of the view created based on
-- the granted privilege.
-- To successfully drop the role, the dependent view
-- and grant must be removed first. For this example:
-- 1. JSmith drops the view:
DROP VIEW invent.partlocView;

-- 2. User administrator revokes the role from the user:
REVOKE ROLE clerks FROM JSmith;

-- 3. User administrator revokes all privileges the role has been granted

The DROP TABLE statement deletes a {project-name} SQL table and its dependent objects such as indexes and constraints.
See <<tables,Tables>>.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That
means that you cannot run this statement inside a user-defined
transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run
this statement, AUTOCOMMIT must be turned ON (the default) for the
session.

```
DROP [VOLATILE] TABLE [IF EXISTS] table [RESTRICT|CASCADE]
```

[[drop_table_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of DROP TABLE

* `VOLATILE`
+
specifies that the table to be dropped is a volatile table.

* `IF EXISTS`
+
drops the HBase table if it exists. This option does not apply to volatile tables.

* `_table_`
+
is the name of the table to delete.

* `RESTRICT`
+
If you specify RESTRICT and the table is referenced by another object, the specified table cannot be dropped.
The default is RESTRICT.

* `CASCADE`
+
If you specify CASCADE, the table and all objects referencing the table (such as a view) are dropped.

[[drop_view_statement]]
== DROP VIEW Statement

The DROP VIEW statement deletes a {project-name} SQL view. See <<views,Views>>.

NOTE: DDL statements are not currently supported in transactions. That means that you cannot run this statement inside
a user-defined transaction (BEGIN WORK&#8230;COMMIT WORK) or when AUTOCOMMIT is OFF. To run this statement, AUTOCOMMIT
must be turned ON (the default) for the session.

```
DROP VIEW view [RESTRICT|CASCADE]
```

[[drop_view_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of DROP VIEW

* `_view_`
+
is the name of the view to delete.

* `RESTRICT`
+
If you specify RESTRICT, you cannot drop the specified view if it is referenced in the query expression of any other
view or in the search condition of another object's constraint. The default is RESTRICT.

* `CASCADE`
+
If you specify CASCADE, any dependent objects are dropped.

[[execute_statement]]
== Execute Statement

The EXECUTE statement executes an SQL statement previously compiled by a PREPARE statement in a {project-name} Command Interface
(TrafCI) session.

```
EXECUTE statement-name
    [ USING param [,param]...] ]

param is:
    ?param-name | literal-value
```

[[execute_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of EXECUTE

* `_statement-name_`
+
is the name of a prepared SQL statement—that is, the statement name used in the PREPARE statement. _statement-name_ is an
SQL identifier. See <<identifiers,Identifiers>>.

* `USING _param_ [,_param_]&#8230;`
+
`_param_ is: ?_param-name_ | _literal-value_`
+
specifies values for unnamed parameters (represented by ?) in the prepared statement in the form of either a parameter
name (?_param-name_) or a literal value (_literal-value_). The data type of a parameter value must be compatible with
the data type of the associated parameter in the prepared statement.
+
Parameter values (_param_) are substituted for unnamed parameters in the prepared statement by position—the i-th value
in the USING clause is the value for the i-th parameter in the statement. If fewer parameter values exist in the USING
clause than unnamed parameters in the PREPARE statement, {project-name} SQL returns an error. If more parameter values exist
in the USING clause than the unnamed parameters in the PREPARE statement, {project-name} SQL issues warning 15019.
+
<<<
+
The USING clause does not set parameter values for named parameters (represented by ?_param-name_) in a prepared statement.
To set parameter values for named parameters, use the SET PARAM command. For more information, see the
{docs-url}/command_interface/index.html[_{project-name} Command Interface Guide_].

** `?_param-name_`
+
The value for a ?_param-name_ must be previously specified with the SET PARAM command. The _param-name_ is case-sensitive.
For information about the SET PARAM command, see the
{docs-url}/command_interface/index.html[_{project-name} Command Interface Guide_].

** `_literal-value_`
+
is a numeric or character literal that specifies the value for the unnamed parameter.
+
If _literal-value_ is a character literal and the target column type is character, you do not have to enclose it in single
quotation marks. Its data type is determined from the data type of the column to which the literal is assigned. If the
_literal-value_ contains leading or trailing spaces, commas, or if it matches any parameter names that are already
set, enclose the _literal-value_ in single quotes.

See the <<prepare_statement,PREPARE Statement>>. For information about the SET PARAM command, see the
{docs-url}/command_interface/index.html[_{project-name} Command Interface Guide_].

[[execute_considerations]]
=== Considerations for EXECUTE

[[execute_scope_of_execute]]
==== Scope of EXECUTE

A statement must be compiled by PREPARE before you EXECUTE it, but after it is compiled, you can execute the statement
multiple times without recompiling it. The statement must have been compiled during the same TrafCI session as its
execution.

<<<
[[execute_examples]]
=== Examples of EXECUTE

* Use PREPARE to compile a statement once, and then execute the statement multiple times with different parameter values.
This example uses the SET PARAM command to set parameter values for named parameters (represented by ?_param-name_) in
the prepared statement.

[[explain_statement]]
== EXPLAIN Statement

The EXPLAIN statement helps you to review query execution plans. You can use the EXPLAIN statement anywhere you can
execute other SQL statements (for example, SELECT). For more information on the EXPLAIN function, see
<<"explain_function","EXPLAIN Function">>.

EXPLAIN is a {project-name} SQL extension.

```
EXPLAIN [OPTIONS {'f'}] { FOR QID query-id | FOR QID CURRENT | prepared-stmt-name | query-text }
```

Plans displayed by the EXPLAIN statement are ordered from top (root operator) to bottom (leaf operators).

[[explain_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of EXPLAIN

* `f`
+
Provides the simple, basic information contained in the query execution plan. This information is formatted for
readability and limited to 79 characters (one line) per operator.
See <<explain_formatted_considerations,Formatted [OPTIONS 'f'] Considerations>>.

* `_CURRENT_`
+
provide information for the latest compiled query.

* `_query-id_`
+
specifies the query ID of a prepared or executing query, which is a unique identifier generated by the SQL compiler.

* `_prepared-stmt-name_`
+
an SQL identifier containing the name of a statement already prepared in this session. An SQL identifier is
case-insensitive (will be in uppercase) unless it is double-quoted. It must be double-quoted if it contains blanks,
lowercase letters, or special characters. It must start with a letter. When you refer to the prepared query in a
SELECT statement, you must use uppercase.

Note: A few non-reserved words that can be used for prepared statement names cannot be used directly in EXPLAIN.
For example, 'EXPLAIN access;' results in a syntax error. You can still use the name, however, by using a
delimited identifier. That is, specify the name in upper case, surrounded by double-quotes. For example,
'EXPLAIN "ACCESS";' will work.

* `_query-text_`
+
specifies the text of a query.

<<<
[[explain_considerations]]
=== Considerations for EXPLAIN


[[explain_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue an EXPLAIN statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You own (that is, issued) the query specified in the EXPLAIN statement.
* You have the SHOW component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component. The SHOW component privilege is granted
to PUBLIC by default.

[[explain_obtaining_explain_plans]]
==== Obtaining EXPLAIN Plans While Queries Are Running

{project-name} SQL provides the ability to capture an EXPLAIN plan for a query at any time while the query is running
with the FOR QID option. By default, this behavior is disabled for a {project-name} database session.

NOTE: Enable this feature before you start preparing and executing queries.

After the feature is enabled, use the FOR QID option in an EXPLAIN statement to get the query execution plan of
a running query.

The EXPLAIN function or statement returns the plan that was generated when the query was prepared. EXPLAIN with
the FOR QID option retrieves all the information from the original plan of the executing query. The plan is available
until the query finishes executing and is removed or deallocated.

<<<
[[explain_case_considerations]]
==== Case Considerations

In most cases, words in the commands can be in uppercase or lowercase. The options letter must be single quoted and in
lowercase.

[[explain_number_considerations]]
==== Number Considerations

Costs are given in a generic unit of effort. They show relative costs of an operation.

When trailing decimal digits are zero, they are dropped. For example, 6.4200 would display as
6.42 and 5.0 would display as 5, without a decimal point.

[[explain_formatted_considerations]]
==== Formatted [OPTIONS 'f'] Considerations

The formatted option is the simplest option. It provides essential, brief information about the plan and shows the
operators and their order within the query execution plan.

OPTIONS 'f' formats the EXPLAIN output into these fields:

[cols="25%,75%"]
|===
| LC                | Left child sequence number
| RC                | Right child sequence number
| OP                | The sequence number of the operator in the query plan
| OPERATOR          | The operator type
| OPT               | Query optimizations that were applied
| DESCRIPTION       | Additional information about the operator
| CARD              | Estimated number of rows returned by the plan. CARDINALITY and ROWS_OUT are the same.
|===

This example uses OPTIONS 'f ':

```
>>explain options 'f' for qid MXID11002015016212343685134956677000000000206U3333300_652_XX;


LC   RC   OP   OPERATOR              OPT       DESCRIPTION           CARD
---- ---- ---- --------------------  --------  --------------------  ---------

1    .    2    root                                                  1.00E+000

--- SQL operation complete.
```

<<<
To use the EXPLAIN statement with a prepared statement, first prepare the query. Then use the EXPLAIN statement:

```
PREPARE q FROM SELECT * FROM REGION;

EXPLAIN options 'f' q;
```

EXPLAIN can also be used with the query text directly:

```
EXPLAIN options 'f' SELECT * FROM REGION;
```

When you specify all for a table or view, 
this includes the select, delete, insert, references, and update privileges. 

When the object is a 
stored procedure or user-defined function (UDF), only the execute privilege is applied.

* `ON _[object-type][schema-name.]object-name_`
+
Specifies an object on which to grant privileges. For more information, see <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>. 

+
If none is specified, it defaults to TABLE. 

+
`_[object-type][schema-name.]object-name_` can be:

** `FUNCTION _[schema-name.]function-name_`, where _function-name_ is the name of a user-defined function (UDF) in the database.
** `LIBRARY _[schema-name.]library-name_`, where _library-name_ is the name of a library object in the database.
** `PROCEDURE _[schema-name.]procedure-name_`, where _procedure-name_ is the name of a stored procedure in java (SPJ) 
registered in the database.
** `SEQUENCE _[schema-name.]sequence-name_`, where _sequence-name_ is the name of a sequence object in the database.
** `[TABLE] _[schema-name.]object_`, where _object_ is a table or view. 

* `TO {_grantee_}`
+
Specifies the  _auth-name_ to which you grant privileges.

* `_auth-name_`
+
Specifies the name of an authorization id to which you grant privileges. For more information, see <<authorization_ids,Authorization IDs>>. 
+
The _auth-name_ is a regular or delimited case-insensitive identifier. For more information, see <<case_insensitive_delimited_identifiers,Case-Insensitive Delimited Identifiers>>.
+
The authorization id must be one of the following:
+
** A registered database username

Specifies that the _auth-name_ to which a privilege is granted may in turn grant the same privilege to other users or roles.
+
NOTE: `WITH GRANT OPTION` cannot be granted to PUBLIC.

+
Allows you to grant privileges on behalf of a role. If not specified, the privileges will be granted on your behalf as 
the current user/grantor.

* `_role-name_`
+
Specifies a role on whose behalf the grant operation is performed. To grant the privileges on behalf of a role, you must 
be a member of the role, and the role must have the authority to grant the privileges; that is, the role must have been 
granted the privileges with grant option.

Specifies the list of columns to grant the requested privilege to.

[[grant_considerations]]
=== Considerations for GRANT

[[grant_authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

* To grant a privilege on an object, you must have both that privilege and the right to grant that privilege. 

* Privileges can be granted directly to you or to one of the roles you have been granted. 

* You can grant a privilege on an object if one of the following is true:
+
** If you are the owner of the object (by which you are implicitly granted all privileges on the object). 

+
** The owner of the schema contains the object.

+
** If you have been granted both the privilege and the `WITH GRANT OPTION` for the privilege.

* If granting privileges on behalf of a role, you must specify the role in the `[GRANTED] BY` clause. 
+
To grant the privileges on behalf of a role, you must be a member of the role, and the role must have the authority to grant the privileges; 
that is, the role must have been granted the privileges `WITH GRANT OPTION`.

* If you lack authority to grant:

** If you lack authority to grant one or more of the specified privileges, SQL returns a warning (yet does grant the specified 
privileges for which you do have authority to grant). 

+
*Example*

+
The owner of the table _customer_ is the _testuser1_, who grants `DELETE`, `INSERT` and `REFERENCES` privileges on the table _customer_ 
to the user _testuser2_ with `WITH GRANT OPTION`.

+
_testuser1_:

+ 
```
SQL>GRANT DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES ON customer TO testuser2 WITH GRANT OPTION;

--- SQL operation complete.
```

+
Then _testuser2_ tries to grant all privileges on table _customer_ to _testuser3_.

+
The grant command returns a warning stating that only some of the privileges were granted.

+
`DELETE`, `INSERT` and `REFERENCES` privileges are granted because _testuser2_ has been granted these privileges with grant option.

+
`SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges are not granted.

+
_testuser2:_

+
```
SQL>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON customer TO testuser3;

*** WARNING[1013] Not all privileges were granted.  You lack grant option for the SELECT privilege. [2018-06-11 16:07:34]

* `ON _component-name_`
+
specifies a component name on which to grant component privileges. Currently, the only valid component name is SQL_OPERATIONS.

* `TO _grantee_`
+
specifies an _auth-name_ to which you grant component privileges.

* `_auth-name_`
+
specifies the name of an authorization ID to which you grant privileges. See <<authorization_ids,Authorization IDs>>. 
The authorization ID must be a registered database username, existing role name, or PUBLIC. The name is a regular or 
delimited case-insensitive identifier. See <<case_insensitive_delimited_identifiers,Case-Insensitive Delimited Identifiers>>.
If you grant a privilege to PUBLIC, the privilege remains available to all users, unless it is later revoked from PUBLIC.

* `WITH GRANT OPTION`
+
specifies that the _auth-name_ to which a component privilege is granted may in turn grant the same component privilege 
to other users or roles.

* `[GRANTED] BY _grantor_`
+
allows you to grant component privileges on behalf of a role. If not specified, the privileges will be granted on your 
behalf as the current user/grantor.

* `_role-name_`
+
specifies a role on whose behalf the GRANT COMPONENT PRIVILEGE operation is performed. To grant the privileges on behalf 
of a role, you must be a member of the role, and the role must have the authority to grant the privileges; that is, the 
role must have been granted the privileges WITH GRANT OPTION.

[[grant_component_privilege_considerations]]
=== Considerations for GRANT COMPONENT PRIVILEGE

* A user or role granted a component privilege WITH GRANT OPTION can grant the same component privilege to other users or roles.
* If all of the component privileges have already been granted, SQL returns an error.
* If one or more component privileges has already been granted, SQL silently ignores the granted privileges and proceeds 
with the grant operation.

[[grant_component_privilege_syntaxauthorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

To grant a component privilege, you must have one of these privileges:

* User administrative privileges (that is, a user who has been granted the MANAGE_USERS component privilege). Initially, 
DB_ROOT is the only database user who has been granted the MANAGE_USERS component privilege.
* A user other than a user administrator who has the WITH GRANT OPTION for the component privilege.
* A user who was granted a role that has the WITH GRANT OPTION privilege for the component privilege.

[[grant_component_privilege_considerations]]
=== Examples of GRANT COMPONENT PRIVILEGE

* Grant a component privilege, CREATE_TABLE, on a component, SQL_OPERATIONS, to SQLUSER1:
+
```
GRANT COMPONENT PRIVILEGE CREATE_TABLE ON SQL_OPERATIONS TO sqluser1;
```

<<<
[[grant_role_statement]]
== GRANT ROLE Statement

The GRANT ROLE statement grants one or more roles to a user. See <<roles,Roles>>.

IMPORTANT: This statement works only when authentication and authorization are enabled in {project-name}. For more information, 
{docs-url}/provisioning_guide/index.html#enable-security [Enable Secure {project-name}].

[[grant_role_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of GRANT ROLE

* `_role-name [,role-name]_`
+ 
specifies the existing roles to grant.

* `TO _grantee_`
+
specifies the registered database username to whom to grant the roles.

[[grant_role_considerations]]
=== Considerations for GRANT ROLE

* To grant roles to other grantees, you must own the roles or have user administrative privileges for the roles. You 
have user administrative privileges for roles if you have been granted the MANAGE_ROLES component privilege. Initially, 
DB ROOT is the only database user who has been granted the MANAGE_ROLES component privilege.
* When you grant a role to a user, the additional privileges are automatically propagated to and detected by active 
sessions. There is no need for users to disconnect from and reconnect to a session to see the updated set of privileges.
* If any errors occur in processing a GRANT ROLE statement that names multiple roles, then no grants are done.
* If you attempt to grant a role but a grant with the same role and grantee already exists, SQL ignores the request and 
returns a successful operation.

[[insert_statement]]
== INSERT Statement

The INSERT statement is a DML statement that inserts rows in a table or
view.

```
INSERT INTO table-name [(target-col-list)] insert-source

target-col-list is:
    colname [,colname]...

insert-source is:
    query-expr [order-by-clause] [access-clause] | DEFAULT VALUES
```

[[insert_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of INSERT

* `_table-name_`
+
names the user table or view in which to insert rows. _table_ must be a base table or an updatable view.

* `_target-col-list_`
+
names the columns in the table or view in which to insert values. The data type of each target column must be 
compatible with the data type of its corresponding source value. Within the list, each target column must
have the same position as its associated source value, whose position is determined by the columns in the table 
derived from the evaluation of the query expression (_query-expr_).
+
If you do not specify all of the columns in _table_ in the _target-col-list_, column default values are inserted 
into the columns that do not appear in the list. See <<column_default_settings,Column Default Settings>>.
+
If you do not specify _target-col-list_, row values from the source table are inserted into all columns in _table_. 
The order of the column values in the source table must be the same order as that of the columns specified in the 
CREATE TABLE for _table_. (This order is the same as that of the columns listed in the result table of `SHOWDDL
table-name`.)

* `_insert-source_`
+
specifies the rows of values to be inserted into all columns of _table_ or, optionally, into specified columns of _table_.

** `_query-expr_`
+
For the description of _query-expr_, _order-by-clause_, and _access-clause_, see the <<select_statement,SELECT Statement>>.

** `DEFAULT VALUES`
+
is equivalent to a _query-expr_ of the form VALUES (DEFAULT, &#8230;). The value of each DEFAULT is the default value defined in 
the column descriptor of _colname_, which is contained in the table descriptor of _table_. Each default value is inserted into 
its column to form a new row. If you specify DEFAULT VALUES, you cannot specify a column list. You can use DEFAULT VALUES only 
when all columns in _table_ have default values.

[[insert_considerations]]
=== Considerations for INSERT

[[insert_authorization_requirements]]
==== Authorization Requirements

INSERT requires authority to read and write to the table or view receiving the data and authority to read tables or views 
specified in the query expression (or any of its subqueries) in the INSERT statement.

[[insert_transaction_initiation_and_termination]]
==== Transaction Initiation and Termination

The INSERT statement automatically initiates a transaction if no transaction is active. Alternatively, you can explicitly initiate 
a transaction with the BEGIN WORK statement. After a transaction is started, the SQL statements execute within that transaction 
until a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is encountered or an error occurs. If AUTOCOMMIT is ON, the transaction terminates at the end of the 
INSERT statement.

[[insert_self_referencing_insert_and_begin_work_or_autocommit_off]]
==== Self-Referencing INSERT and BEGIN WORK or AUTOCOMMIT OFF

A self-referencing INSERT statement is one that references, in the statement's _insert-source_, the same table or view into which 
rows will be inserted (see <<examples_of_self_referencing_inserts,Examples of Self-Referencing Inserts>>). A self-referencing INSERT
statement will not execute correctly and an error is raised if either BEGIN WORK or AUTOCOMMIT OFF is used unless the compiler's 
plan sorts the rows before they are inserted. If you want to use a self-referencing INSERT statement, you should avoid the use of 
BEGIN WORK or AUTOCOMMIT OFF. For information about AUTOCOMMIT, see the <<set_transaction_statement,SET TRANSACTION Statement>>.

[[insert_isolation-levels-of-transactions-and-access-options-of-statements]]
==== Isolation Levels of Transactions and Access Options of Statements

The isolation level of an SQL transaction defines the degree to which the operations on data within that transaction are affected by
operations of concurrent transactions. When you specify access options for the DML statements within a transaction, you override the 
isolation level of the containing transaction. Each statement then executes with its individual access option.

[[insert_use_of_a_values_clause_for_the_source_query_expression]]
==== Use of a VALUES Clause for the Source Query Expression

If the query expression consists of the VALUES keyword followed by rows of values, each row consists of a list of value expressions 
or a row subquery (a subquery that returns a single row of column values). A value in a row can also be a scalar subquery (a subquery 
that returns a single row consisting of a single column value).

Within a VALUES clause, the operands of a value expression can be numeric, string, datetime, or interval values; however, an operand
cannot reference a column (except in the case of a scalar or row subquery returning a value or values in its result table).

[[insert_requirements_for_inserted_rows]]
==== Requirements for Inserted Rows

Each row to be inserted must satisfy the constraints of the table or underlying base table of the view. A table constraint is satisfied if
the check condition is not false—it is either true or has an unknown value.

[[insert_using_compatible_data_types]]
==== Using Compatible Data Types

To insert a row, you must provide a value for each column in the table that has no default value. The data types of the values in each row to
be inserted must be compatible with the data types of the corresponding target columns.

===== Inserting Character Values

Any character string data type is compatible with all other character string data types that have the same character set. For fixed length, an
inserted value shorter than the column length is padded on the right with blank characters of the appropriate character set (for example,
ISO88591 blanks (HEX20). If the value is longer than the column length, string truncation of non-blank trailing characters returns an error, and
the truncated string is not inserted.

For variable length, a shorter inserted value is not padded. As is the case for fixed length, if the value is longer than the column length,
string truncation of non-blank trailing characters returns an error, and the truncated string is not inserted.

===== Inserting Numeric Values

Any numeric data type is compatible with all other numeric data types. If you insert a value into a numeric column that 
is not large enough,  an overflow error occurs. If a value has more digits to the right of the decimal point than 
specified by the scale for the column definition,  the value is truncated.

===== Inserting Interval Values

A value of interval data type is compatible with another value of interval data type only if the two data types are both 
year-month or both day-time intervals.

===== Inserting Date and Time Values

Date, time, and timestamp are the three {project-name} SQL datetime data types. A value with a datetime data type is compatible 
with another value with a datetime data type only if the values have the same datetime fields.

===== Inserting Nulls

and inserting values with specific data types, you might want to insert nulls. To insert null, use the keyword NULL. NULL 
only works with the VALUES clause. Use cast (null as _type_) for select-list.

[[insert_examples]]
=== Examples of INSERT

* Insert a row into the CUSTOMER table without using a _target-col-list_:
+
```
INSERT INTO sales.customer

VALUES (4777, 'ZYROTECHNIKS', '11211 40TH ST.', 'BURLINGTON', 'MASS.',
'01803', 'A2');

--- 1 row(s) inserted.
```
+
The column name list is not specified for this INSERT statement. This operation works because the number of values listed 
in the VALUES clause is equal to the number of columns in the CUSTOMER table, and the listed values appear in the same 
order as the columns specified in the CREATE TABLE statement for the CUSTOMER table.
+
By issuing this SELECT statement, this specific order is displayed:
+
```
SELECT * FROM sales.customer WHERE custnum = 4777;

CUSTNUM       CUSTNAME       STREET          ... POSTCODE CREDIT
------------- -------------- ---------------     -------- ------
         4777 ZYROTECHNIKS   11211 4OTH ST.  ... 01803    A2

--- 1 row(s) selected.
```

* Insert a row into the CUSTOMER table using a _target-col-list_:
+
```
INSERT INTO sales.customer
(custnum, custname, street, city, state, postcode) 
VALUES (1120, 'EXPERT MAILERS', '5769 N. 25TH PL',
        'PHOENIX', 'ARIZONA', '85016');

--- 1 row(s) inserted.
```
Unlike the previous example, the insert source of this statement does not contain a value for the CREDIT column, which 
has a default value. As a result, this INSERT must include the column name list.
+
This SELECT statement shows the default value 'C1' for CREDIT:
+
```
SELECT * FROM sales.customer WHERE custnum = 1120;

CUSTNUM       CUSTNAME       STREET          ... POSTCODE CREDIT
------------- -------------- ---------------     -------- ------
         1120 EXPERT MAILERS 5769 N. 25TH PL ... 85016    C1

--- 1 row(s) selected.
```

* Insert multiple rows into the JOB table by using only one INSERT statement:
+
```
INSERT INTO persnl.job 
   VALUES (100,'MANAGER'),
          (200,'PRODUCTION SUPV'), 
          (250,'ASSEMBLER'),
          (300,'SALESREP'), 
          (400,'SYSTEM ANALYST'), 
          (420,'ENGINEER'),
          (450,'PROGRAMMER'),
          (500,'ACCOUNTANT'), 
          (600,'ADMINISTRATOR'), 
          (900,'SECRETARY');

--- 10 row(s) inserted.
```

* The PROJECT table consists of five columns using the data types numeric, varchar, date, timestamp, and interval. 
Insert values by using these types:
+
```
INSERT INTO persnl.project
    VALUES (1000, 'SALT LAKE CITY', DATE '2007-10-02', 
    TIMESTAMP '2007-12-21 08:15:00.00', INTERVAL '30' DAY);

--- 1 row(s) inserted.
```

<<<
* Suppose that CUSTLIST is a view of all columns of the CUSTOMER table except the credit rating. Insert information 
from the SUPPLIER table into the CUSTOMER table through the CUSTLIST view, and then update the credit rating:
+
```
INSERT INTO sales.custlist 
  (SELECT * FROM invent.supplier
   WHERE suppnum = 10);

UPDATE sales.customer 
  SET credit = 'A4' 
  WHERE custnum = 10;
```
+
You could use this sequence in the following situation. Suppose that one of your suppliers has become a customer. 
If you use the same number for both the customer and supplier numbers, you can select the information from the SUPPLIER 
table for the new customer and insert it into the CUSTOMER table through the CUSTLIST view (as shown in the example).

This operation works because the columns of the SUPPLIER table contain values that correspond to the columns of the 
CUSTLIST view. Further, the credit rating column in the CUSTOMER table is specified with a default value. If you want 
a credit rating that is different from the default, you must update this column in the row of new customer data.

[[insert_examples_of_self_referencing_inserts]]
==== Examples of Self-Referencing Inserts

* This is an example of a self-referencing insert:
+
```

```

* This is an example of a self-referencing insert where the target of the insert, table1, is also used in a subquery of the insert-source:
+
```
insert into table1
  select a+16, b, c from table2 where table2.b not in 
    (select b from table1 where a > 16)

The INVOKE statement generates a record description that corresponds to a row in the specified table, view, or index. 
The record description includes a data item for each column in the table, view, or index, including the primary key but 
excluding the SYSKEY column. It includes the SYSKEY column of a view only if the view explicitly listed the column in its 
definition.

INVOKE is a {project-name} SQL extension.

The ON predicate must select a unique row if the MERGE has a _when-not-matched-clause_.

<<<
[[merge_considerations]]
=== Considerations for MERGE

[[merge_upsert_using_single_row]]
==== Upsert Using Single Row

A MERGE statement allows you to specify a set of column values that should be updated if the row is found, and another 
row to be inserted if the row is not found. The ON predicate must select exactly one row that is to be updated if the 
MERGE statement has an INSERT clause.

In a MERGE statement, at least one of the clauses _when-matched_ or _when-not-matched_ must be specified. Note the following:

* If a _when-matched_ clause is present and the WHERE predicate in the UPDATE is satisfied, the columns in the SET clause are updated.
* If a _when-matched_ clause is present and the WHERE predicate in the UPDATE is not satisfied, the columns in the SET clause are not updated.
* If a _when-matched_ clause is present and the UPDATE has no WHERE predicate, the columns in the SET clause are updated.
* If a _when-not-matched_ clause is present and columns are explicitly specified in the INSERT clause, the specified values for those columns
are inserted. Missing columns are updated using the default values for those columns.

This example updates column b to 20 if the row with key column a with value 10 is found. A new row (10, 30) is inserted if the row is not
found in table t.

```
MERGE INTO t ON a = 10
  WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET b = 20
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (10, 30)
```

This example updates column b to 20 if column a with value 10 is found. If column a with value 10 is not found, nothing is done.

```
MERGE INTO t ON a = 10
  WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET b = 20
```

<<<
This example inserts values (10, 30) if column a with value 10 is not found. If column a with value 10 is found, nothing is done.

```
MERGE INTO t ON a = 10
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (10, 30)
```

[[merge_conditional_upsert_using_single_row]]
==== Conditional Upsert Using Single Row

In this example, the MERGE statement uses a single-row conditional upsert that inserts one row (keycol, col, seqnum) value 
if a row with that keycol (parameter-specified) value is not yet in table d. Otherwise, the MERGE statement updates that 
row's col and seqnum columns if that row's seqnum is higher than the current (parameter-specified) sequence number. If the 
matching row's seqnum column value is not higher than the current sequence number, then that matched row is not updated.

```
MERGE INTO d ON keycol = ?
  WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET (col, seqnum) = (?, ?) WHERE seqnum < ?
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (keycol, col, seqnum) VALUES (?, ?, ?)
```

The optional WHERE predicate in the _when-matched-then-update_ clause is useful when the update is wanted only if the given 
condition is satisfied. Consider this use case. Suppose object

X is represented as a row in table T. Also, suppose a stream of updates exists for object X. The updates are marked by a 
sequence number at their source. However, the updates flow through a network which does not guarantee first-in, first-out 
delivery. In fact, the updates may arrive out-of-order to the database. In this case, the last update (the one with the current 
highest sequence number) should always win in the database. The MERGE statement shown above can be used to satisfy this
use case:

* A stream of updates for table d exists that are sequenced by a sequence number seqnum at their source
* The updates race through the network and may arrive in the database in any order, and
* You want to guarantee that the last update (the one with the highest seqnum) always wins in the database.

[[merge_restrictions]]
==== Restrictions

* The MERGE statement does not use ESP parallelism.

+
```
MERGE INTO t ON a = (SELECT a FROM t1) WHEN ...

[[merge_merge_from_one_table_into_another]]
==== MERGE From One Table Into Another

The MERGE statement can be used to upsert all matching rows from the source table into the target table. 
Each row from the source table is treated as the source of a single upsert statement. The _using-clause_
contains the _select-query_ whose output is used as the source to the MERGE statement.

The source _select-query_ must be renamed using the AS clause.

```
MERGE INTO t ON
  USING (_select-query_) AS Z(X) ON col = Z.X 
  WHEN MATCHED THEN . . .
```

For each row selected out of the select-query, the MERGE statement is evaluated. Values selected are used 
in the _on-clause_ to join with the column of the merged table. If the value is found, it is updated. If it
is not found, the insert is done. The restrictions are the same as those for <<upsert_using_single_row, Upsert Using Single Row>>.

[[merge_examples]]
=== Examples of MERGE

* This query extracts derived columns a and b from the USING query as derived table z and use each row to join to the 
merged table t based on the _on-clause_. For each matched row, column b in table t is updated using column b in derived 
table z. For rows that are not matched, values z.a and z.b are inserted.
+
```
MERGE INTO t USING
  (SELECT * FROM t1) z(a,b) on a = z.a 
  WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET b = z.b
  WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (z.a, z.b);

[[prepare_statement]]
== PREPARE Statement

The PREPARE statement compiles an SQL statement for later use with the EXECUTE statement in the same {project-name} Command 
Interface (TrafCI) session.

You can also use PREPARE to check the syntax of a statement without executing the statement in the same TrafCI session.

```
PREPARE statement-name FROM statement
```

[[prepare_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of PREPARE

* `_statement-name_`
+
is an SQL identifier that specifies a name to be used for the prepared statement. See <<identifiers,Identifiers>>.
The statement name should be a character string and not a numeric value. If you specify the name of an existing
prepared statement, the new statement overwrites the previous one.

* `_statement_`
+
specifies the SQL statement to prepare.

[[prepare_considerations]]
=== Considerations for PREPARE

[[prepare_availability_of_a_prepared_statement]]
==== Availability of a Prepared Statement

If a PREPARE statement fails, any subsequent attempt to run EXECUTE on the named statement fails. Only the TrafCI 
session that executes the PREPARE can run EXECUTE on the prepared statement.

The prepared statement is available for running EXECUTE until you terminate the TrafCI session.

A statement must be compiled by PREPARE before you can run EXECUTE on it. However, after the statement is compiled, 
you can run EXECUTE on the statement multiple times without recompiling the statement.

[[register_user_statement]]
== REGISTER USER Statement

The REGISTER USER statement registers a user in the SQL database, associating the user's login name with a database username.

REGISTER USER is a {project-name} SQL extension.

NOTE: The user's login name is also the name by which the user is defined in the directory service, so the syntax description
below refers to it as the _directory-service username_.

```
REGISTER USER directory-service-username [ AS database-username ]
```

[[register_user_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of REGISTER USER

* `_directory-service-username_`
+
is the name that identifies the user in the directory service. This is also the name the user specifies when logging in to
a {project-name} database. The _directory-service-username_ is a regular or delimited case-insensitive identifier.
See <<case_insensitive_delimited_identifiers,Case-Insensitive Delimited Identifiers>>.

* `_database-username_`
+
is a regular or delimited case-insensitive identifier that denotes the username as defined in the database. The database
username cannot be identical to a registered database username or an existing role name. However, it can be the same as
the directory-service username. If you omit the AS _database-username_ clause, the database username will be the same as
the directory-service username.

[[register_user_register_user_considerations]]
=== Considerations for REGISTER USER
[[register_user_who_can_register_a_user]]
==== Who Can Register a User

To register a user, you must have user administrative privileges. You have user administrative privileges if you have
been granted the MANAGE_USERS component privilege. Initially, DB ROOT is the only database user who has been granted
the MANAGE_USERS component privilege.

<<<
[[register_user_add_the_user_to_the_directory_before_registering_the_user]]
==== Add the User to the Directory Before Registering the User

Add the user to the appropriate directory service before you register the user. Otherwise, REGISTER USER will fail.

[[register_user_as_database_user_clause]]
==== AS _database-username_ Clause

Use the AS _database-username_ clause to assign a database username that is different than the username defined in
the directory service. In particular, it is often convenient to assign a database username that is shorter and easier
to type than the directory-service username.

For example, if the user logs on as `John.Allen.Doe.the.Second@mycompany.com`, you might want to assign the user a
database username of JDoe.

Database user names are authorization IDs. If you specify a name already assigned to another user or to an existing
role, the command will fail. For more information, see <<authorization_ids,Authorization IDs>>.

[[register_user_reserved_names]]
==== Reserved Names

PUBLIC, _SYSTEM, NONE, and database user names beginning with DB are reserved. You cannot register users with any
such name.

[[register_user_username_length]]
==== Username Length

Database user names are limited to 128 characters.

[[register_user_examples]]
=== Examples of REGISTER USER

* To register a user and assign a database username different than the user's login name:
+
```
REGISTER USER "jsmith@company.com" AS jsmith;
```

* To register a user without specifying a database username, so the database username will be the same as the user's login name:
+
```
REGISTER USER "jsmith@company.com";
```

=== Syntax Description of REVOKE

* `GRANT OPTION FOR`
+
Specifies that the grantee’s authority to grant the specified privileges to other users or roles (that is, WITH GRANT
OPTION) be revoked. This is an optional clause. When this clause is specified, only the ability to grant the privilege
to another user is revoked.

* `_privilege_ [, _privilege_ ] &#8230; | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ]`
+
Specifies the privileges to revoke. You can specify these privileges for an object:
+
[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| DELETE                   | Revokes the ability to use the DELETE statement.
| EXECUTE                  | Revokes the ability to execute a stored procedure using a CALL statement or revokes the ability to execute a user-defined function (UDF).
| INSERT     [columm-list] | Revokes the ability to use the INSERT statement.
| REFERENCES [column-list] | Revokes the ability to create constraints that reference the object.
| SELECT     [column-list] | Revokes the ability to use the SELECT statement.
| UPDATE     [column-list] | Revokes the ability to use the UPDATE statement.
| USAGE                    | For libraries, revokes the ability to access a library using the 
CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE FUNCTION statement.
For sequence generators, revokes the ability to access a sequence in a SQL query.
| ALL                      | Revokes the ability to use all privileges that apply to the object type.
When you specify ALL for a table or view, this includes the SELECT, DELETE, INSERT, REFERENCES, and 
UPDATE privileges. When the object is a stored procedure or user-defined function (UDF), this includes 
the EXECUTE privilege.  When the object is a library, this includes the UPDATE and USAGE privileges. 
When the object is a sequence generator, only the usage privilege is applied.
|===

* `ON [_object-type_] [_schema_.]_object_`
+
Specifies an object on which to grant privileges. If none is specified, it defaults to TABLE. See <<database_object_names,"Database Object Names>> for more details. _object-type_ can be:

** FUNCTION [_schema_.]_function-name_, where _function-name_ is the name of a user-defined function in the database.
** LIBRARY [_schema_.]_library-name_, where _library-name_ is the name of a library object in the database. 
** PROCEDURE [_schema_.]_procedure-name_, where _procedure-name_ is the name of a stored procedure in Java (SPJ)
registered in the database. 
** SEQUENCE [_schema_.]_sequence-name_, where _sequence-name_ is the name of a sequence generator.
** [TABLE] [_schema_.]_object-name_, where _object-name_ is the name of a table or view. 

* `FROM {_grantee_ [,_grantee_] &#8230; }`
+
Specifies an _auth-name_ from which you revoke privileges.

* `_auth-name_`
+
Specifies the name of an authorization ID from which you revoke privileges. See <<authorization_ids,Authorization IDs>>.
The authorization ID must be a registered database username, existing role name, or PUBLIC. The name is
a regular or delimited case-insensitive identifier. See
<<case_insensitive_delimited_identifiers,Case-Insensitive Delimited Identifiers>>.

* `[GRANTED] BY _grantor_`
+
Allows you to revoke privileges on behalf of a role. If not specified, the privileges will be revoked
on your behalf as the current user/grantor.

* `_role-name_`
+
Specifies a role on whose behalf the GRANT operation was performed. To revoke the privileges on behalf of a role,
you must be a member of the role, and the role must have the authority to revoke the privileges;
that is, the role must have been granted the privileges WITH GRANT OPTION.

* `_column-list_`
+
Specifies the list of columns to revoke the requested privilege from.

[[revoke_considerations]]
=== Considerations for REVOKE

[[revoke_authorization_and_availability_requirements]]
==== Authorization and Availability Requirements

You can revoke privileges for which you are the grantor, either through a direct grant or a grant done on your
behalf. If you are revoking privileges that were granted on behalf of a role, you must be a member of the role,
and you must specify the role in the [GRANTED] BY clause.

If one or more privileges have not been granted, SQL returns a warning.

When you specify the CASCADE option, all objects that were created based upon the privileges being revoked are removed.

[[revoke_examples]]
=== Examples of REVOKE

* To revoke GRANT OPTION for column level SELECT and table level DELETE privileges on a table from a user:
+
```
REVOKE GRANT OPTION FOR SELECT (part_no, part_name), DELETE ON TABLE invent.partloc FROM jsmith;
```

* To revoke the privilege to grant SELECT and DELETE privileges on a table from a user and a role:
+
```
REVOKE SELECT (part_no, part_name), DELETE ON TABLE invent.partloc FROM jsmith, clerks;
```

* To revoke a user’s SELECT privileges on a table.
+
User administrator grants the SELECT privilege to _JSMITH_.
+
```
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE invent.partloc TO jsmith WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
+
_JSMITH_ grants the SELECT privilege to _AJONES_.
+
```
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE invent.partloc TO ajones;
```
+
If the user administrator attempts to revoke the SELECT privilege from _JSMITH_, this would fail because of 
the privilege granted to _AJONES_ based on the privilege granted to _JSMITH_. To successfully revoke the SELECT privilege from _JSMITH_, the SELECT privilege granted to _AJONES_ 
must be revoked first. 
+
For this example:
+
_JSMITH_ revokes the SELECT privilege granted to _AJONES_.
+
```
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE invent.partloc FROM ajones;
```
+
User administrator revokes the SELECT privilege on the table from _JSMITH_, the REVOKE operation succeeds.
+
```
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE invent.partloc FROM jsmith RESTRICT;
```
+
An easier way to make the REVOKE operation successful is to use the `CASCADE option`.
+
The REVOKE operation succeeds because the `CASCADE option` causes all specified privileges, and all privileges that
were granted based upon the specified privileges, to be removed.
+
```
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE invent.partloc FROM jsmith CASCADE;
```

* Administration in the shipping department decides that the _CLERKS_ role should no longer be able to grant
privileges on the _invent.partloc_ table. _Fred_ has recently moved to another department, so _JSMITH_ revokes
the SELECT privilege on the _invent.partloc_ table from _Fred_, who was granted the privilege by _CLERKS_. Then,
_JSMITH_ revokes the grant option from _CLERKS_:
+
```
REVOKE SELECT on table invent.partloc FROM fred GRANTED BY clerks;
REVOKE GRANT OPTION FOR SELECT ON TABLE invent.partloc FROM clerks;
```

=== Syntax Description of REVOKE COMPONENT PRIVILEGE

* `GRANT OPTION FOR`
+
specifies that the grantee’s authority to grant the specified component privileges to other users or roles (that is,
WITH GRANT OPTION) be revoked. This is an optional clause. When this clause is specified, only the ability to grant
the component privilege to another user is revoked.

* `_privilege-name_`
+
specifies one or more component privileges to revoke. The comma-separated list can include only privileges within the
same component.

* `ON _component-name_`
+
specifies a valid component name on which to revoke component privileges. Currently, the only valid component name is
SQL_OPERATIONS.

* `FROM _grantee_`
+
specifies an _auth-name_ from which you revoke the component privileges.

* `_auth-name_`
+
specifies the name of an authorization ID from which you revoke privileges. See <<authorization_ids,Authorization IDs>>.
The authorization ID must be a registered database username, existing role name, or PUBLIC. The name is a regular or
delimited case-insensitive identifier. See
<<case_insensitive_delimited_identifiers,Case-Insensitive Delimited Identifiers>>.

* `[ GRANTED ] BY _grantor_`
+
allows you to revoke component privileges on behalf of a role. If not specified, the component privileges will be revoked
on your behalf as the current user/grantor.

* `_role-name_`
+
specifies a role on whose behalf the GRANT COMPONENT PRIVILEGE operation was performed. To revoke the privileges on behalf
of a role, you must be a member of the role, and the role must have the authority to revoke the privileges; that is, the
role must have been granted the privileges WITH GRANT OPTION.

[[revoke_component_privilege_considerations]]
=== Considerations for REVOKE COMPONENT PRIVILEGE

* At revoke time, all privileges granted WITH GRANT OPTION are removed. That is, the revoke behavior is CASCADE.
* If none of the component privileges has been granted, SQL returns an error.
* If one or more component privileges have not been granted, SQL silently ignores those privileges and proceeds with
the revoke operation.
* Component privileges must be revoked before a role can be dropped or a user unregistered. If any privileges have been
granted to a role or user, an error is returned when that role is dropped or the user unregistered. For more information,
see the <<drop_role_statement,DROP ROLE Statement>> and the <<unregister_user_statement,UNREGISTER USER Statement>>.

+
specifies the registered database username from whom you revoke the roles.

* `[ RESTRICT | CASCADE ]`
+
If you specify RESTRICT, the REVOKE ROLE operation fails if any privileges were granted to
the role or any objects were created based upon those privileges.
+
If you specify CASCADE, any dependent privileges are removed as part of the REVOKE ROLE operation.
+
The default value is RESTRICT.

<<<
[[revoke_role_considerations]]
=== Considerations for REVOKE ROLE

* To revoke roles from users, you must own the roles or have user administrative privileges for the roles. You have
user administrative privileges for roles if have been granted the MANAGE_ROLES component privilege. Initially,
DB ROOT is the only database user who has been granted the MANAGE_ROLES component privilege.
* If RESTRICT (or nothing) is specified and if you want to revoke a role from a user that has created objects based
solely on role privileges, you must drop the objects before revoking the role. However, if you specify CASCADE, the
dependent objects are automatically dropped, and the role is revoked.
* All of the specified roles must have been granted to the specified user. If any role has not been granted to the user,
the operation returns an error, and no roles are revoked.
* When you revoke a role from a user, the reduction in privileges is automatically propagated to and detected by
active sessions. There is no need for users to disconnect from and reconnect to a session to see the updated set of privileges.
* If the REVOKE ROLE names multiple roles and any errors occur in processing, no revokes are performed.

[[revoke_role_examples]]
=== Examples of REVOKE ROLE

* To revoke multiple roles from a user:

[[select_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of SELECT

* with-clause

+
With-clause, known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or subquery factoring clause, was introduced in the SQL-99 standard and has been implemented into Trafodion R2.1.

+
The with-clause assigns an alias to a complex expression. The alias is treated like a temporary table or an inline view that lasts only for the duration of the query and can be referenced multiple times in the same query.

+
By abstracting the complicated parts of the query into simpler, separate and logical blocks, and possibly materializing the results of these parts to avoid recomputing it multiple times, the with-clause has following advantages:

** Simplifies complicated queries, increasing readability and reducing repeated references.
** Builds reusable units and decreases maintenance cost.
** Shortens response time and enhances performance of the query.
** Improves  compatibility with other systems which support with-clause as well.

* cte-table-name
+
specifies the unique name of the CTE to be created, which is a valid SQL identifier with a maximum of 128 characters. Duplicate names are not allowed in a single with-clause.

* `"[" ANY _N_ "]" | "[" FIRST _N_ "]" | "[" LAST _N_ "]" `
+
specifies that _N_ rows are to be returned (assuming the table has at least _N_ rows and that the qualification
criteria specified in the WHERE clause, if any, would select at least _N_ rows) and you do not care which _N_ rows
are chosen (out of the qualified rows) to actually be returned.
+
You must enclose `ANY _N_`, `FIRST _N_` or `LAST _N_` in square brackets ([]). The quotation marks ("") around each square bracket in
the syntax diagram indicate that the bracket is a required character that you must type as shown (for example, [ANY 10]
or [FIRST 5]). Do not include quotation marks in ANY or FIRST clauses.
+
[FIRST _N_] is different from [ANY _N_] only if you use ORDER BY on any of the columns in the select list to sort the
result table of the SELECT statement. _N_ is an unsigned numeric literal with no scale. If _N_ is greater than the number
of rows in the table, all rows are returned. [ANY _N_] and [FIRST _N_] are disallowed in nested SELECT statements and on
either side of a UNION operation.
+
`[LAST _N_]` performs the entire query and calculates elapsed time. The _N_ must be 0 or 1. `[LAST _0_]` does not return any rows. `[LAST _1_]` returns only the last qualified row.

* `ALL | DISTINCT`
+
specifies whether to retrieve all rows whose columns are specified by the _select-list_ (ALL) or only rows that are not
duplicates (DISTINCT). Nulls are considered equal for the purpose of removing duplicates. The default is ALL.

<<<
* `_select-list_`
+
specifies the columns or column expressions to select from the table references in the FROM clause.
See the discussion of limitations in <<considerations_for_select_list,Considerations for Select List>>.


** *
+
specifies all columns in a table, view, joined table, or derived table determined by the evaluation of a query expression,
as specified in the FROM clause.

** `_corr_.*`
+
specifies all columns of specific table references by using the correlation name _corr_ of the table references, as
specified in the FROM clause. See <<correlation_names,Correlation Names>>.

** `_corr_._single-col_ [[AS] _name_]`
+
specifies one column of specific table references by using the correlation name of the table reference, as specified in
the FROM clause. See <<correlation_names,Correlation Names>>. By using the AS clause, you can associate the column with
a _name_. _name_ is an SQL identifier. See <<identifiers,Identifiers>>.

** `_single-col_ [[AS] _name_]`
+
specifies a column. By using the AS clause, you can associate the column with a _name_. _name_ is an SQL identifier. See
<<identifiers,Identifiers>>.

** `_col-expr_ [[AS] _name_]`
+
specifies a derived column determined by the evaluation of an SQL value expression in the list. By using the AS clause,
you can associate a derived column, _col-expr_, with a _name_. _name_ is an SQL identifier. See <<identifiers,Identifiers>>.

* `FROM _table-ref_ [,_table-ref_]&#8230;`
+
specifies a list of tables, views, derived tables, or joined tables that determine the contents of an intermediate result
table from which {project-name} SQL returns the columns you specify in _select-list_.
+
If you specify only one _table-ref_, the intermediate result table consists of rows derived from that table reference. If you specify more
than one _table-ref_, the intermediate result table is the cross-product of result tables derived from the individual table
references.

<<<
** `table [[AS] corr [(col-expr-list)]] | view [[AS] corr [(col-expr-list)]] |
(query-expr) [AS] corr [(col-expr-list)] | (delete-statement [RETURN
select-list]) [AS] corr [(col-expr-list)] | (update-statement [RETURN
select-list]) [AS] corr [(col-expr-list)] | (insert-statement) [AS] corr
[(col-expr-list)] | joined-table`
+
specifies a _table-ref_ as a single table, view, derived table determined by the evaluation of a query expression, or a joined table.
+
You can specify this optional clause for a table or view. This clause is required for a derived table:

*** `[AS] _corr_ [(_col-expr-list)_]`
+
specifies a correlation name, _corr_, for the preceding table reference _table-ref_ in the FROM clause.
See <<correlation_names,Correlation Names>>.

*** `_col-expr_ [[AS] _name_] [,_col-expr_ [[AS] _name_]] &#8230;`
+
specifies the items in _col-expr-list_, a list of derived columns. By using the AS clause, you can associate a derived column,
_col-expr_, with a _name_. _name_ is an SQL identifier. See <<identifiers,Identifiers>>.
+
For the specification of a query expression, see the syntax diagram for _query-expr_ above.

** `(_delete-statement_ [RETURN _select-list_]) [AS] _corr_ [(_col-expr-list_)]`
+
enables an application to read and delete rows with a single operation. For the syntax of
_delete-statement_, see the <<delete_statement, DELETE Statement>>.

*** `RETURN _select-list_`
+
specifies the columns or column expressions returned from the deleted row. the items in the _select-list_ can be of these forms:

**** `[old.]*`
+
specifies the row from the old table exposed by the embedded delete. the old table refers to column values before the delete
operation. new is not allowed. an implicit old.* return list is assumed for a delete operation that does not specify a return list.

<<<
**** `_col-expr_ [[AS] _name_]`
+
specifies a derived column determined by the evaluation of an sql value expression in the list. Any column referred to in a value
expression is from the row in the old table exposed by the delete. The old table refers to column values before the delete operation.
+
By using the `AS clause`, you can associate a derived column, _col-expr_, with a _name_. _name_ is an SQL identifier. See
<<identifiers,Identifier>>.

*** `[AS] _corr_ [(_col-expr-list_)]`
+
specifies a correlation name, _corr_, and an optional column list for the preceding items in the select list RETURN _select-list_.
See <<correlation_names,Correlation Names>>.

** `(_update-statement_ [RETURN _select-list_]) [AS] _corr_ [(_col-expr-list_)]`
+
enables an application to read and update rows with a single operation. For the syntax of _update-statement_, see the
<<update_statement,UPDATE Statement>>.

*** `RETURN _select-list_`
+
specifies the columns or column expressions returned from the updated row. The items in the _select-list_ can be of these forms:

**** `[OLD.| NEW.]*`
+
specifies the row from the old or new table exposed by the update. The old table refers to column values before the update
operation; the new table refers to column values after the update operation. If a column has not been updated, the new value
is equivalent to the old value.
+
An implicit NEW.* return list is assumed for an update operation that
does not specify a return list.

<<<
**** `_col-expr_ [[AS] _name_]`
+
specifies a derived column determined by the evaluation of an SQL value expression in the list. Any column referred to in
a value expression can be specified as being from the row in the old table exposed by the update or can be specified as being
from the row in the new table exposed by the update.
+
For example:
+
```
RETURN old.empno,old.salary,new.salary, (new.salary - old.salary).
```
+
By using the AS clause, you can associate a derived column, _col-expr_, with a _name_. _name_ is an SQL identifier.
See <<identifiers,Identifiers>>.

*** `[AS] _corr_ [(_col-expr-list_)]`
+
specifies a correlation name, _corr_, and an optional column list for the preceding items in the select list RETURN
_select-list_. See <<correlation_names,Correlation Names>>. For example:
+
```
RETURN old.empno,old.salary,new.salary,
   (new.salary - old.salary)
AS emp (empno, oldsalary, newsalary, increase).
```

** `(_insert-statement_) [AS] _corr_ [(_col-expr-list_)]`
+
For the syntax of _insert-statement_, see the <<insert_statement,INSERT Statement>>.

*** `[AS] _corr_ [(_col-expr-list_)]`
+
specifies a correlation name, _corr_, and an optional column list. See <<correlation_names,Correlation Names>>.

** `_joined-table_`
+
A _joined-table_ can be specified as:
+
```
table-ref [join-type] JOIN table-ref join-spec
| table-ref NATURAL [join-type] JOIN table-ref
| table-ref CROSS JOIN table-ref
| (joined-table)
```

<<<
*** `_join-type_` is: 
+
`INNER | LEFT [OUTER] | RIGHT [OUTER] | FULL [OUTER]`
+
is a joined table. You specify the `_join-type_` by using the CROSS, INNER, OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL keywords.
If you omit the optional OUTER keyword and use LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL in a join, {project-name} SQL assumes the join is
an outer join.

*** `_join-spec_`
+
If you specify an INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL join as the _join-type_ and you do not specify a NATURAL join, you
must use an ON clause as the _join-spec_, as follows: subqueries are not allowed in the join predicate of FULL OUTER JOIN.

*** `ON _search-condition_`
+
specifies a _search-condition_ for the join. Each column reference in _search-condition_ must be a column that exists
in either of the two result tables derived from the table references to the left and right of the JOIN keyword. A join
of two rows in the result tables occurs if the condition is satisfied for those rows.
+
The type of join and the join specification if used determine which rows are joined from the two table references, as follows:

**** `_table-ref_ CROSS JOIN _table-ref_`
+
joins each row of the left _table-ref_ with each row of the right _table-ref_.

**** `_table-ref_ NATURAL JOIN _table-ref_`
+
joins rows only where the values of all columns that have the same name in both tables match. This option is equivalent
to NATURAL INNER.

**** `_table-ref_ NATURAL LEFT JOIN _table-ref_`
+
joins rows where the values of all columns that have the same name in both tables match, plus rows from the left _table-ref_
that do not meet this condition.

**** `_table-ref_ NATURAL RIGHT JOIN _table-ref_`
+
joins rows where the values of all columns that have the same name in both tables match, plus rows from the right _table-ref_
that do not meet this condition.

<<<
**** `_table-ref_ NATURAL FULL JOIN _table-ref_`
+
joins rows where the values of all columns that have the same name in both tables match, plus rows from either side that
do not meet this condition, filling in NULLs for missing values.

**** `_table-ref_ JOIN _table-ref join-spec_`
+
joins only rows that satisfy the condition in the _join-spec_ clause. This option is equivalent to INNER JOIN &#8230; ON.

**** `_table-ref_ LEFT JOIN _table-ref join-spec_`
+
joins rows that satisfy the condition in the _join-spec_ clause, plus rows from the left _table-ref_ that do not
satisfy the condition.

**** `_table-ref_ RIGHT JOIN _table-ref join-spec_`
+
joins rows that satisfy the condition in the _join-spec_ clause, plus rows from the right
_table-ref_ that do not satisfy the condition.

**** `_table-ref_ FULL OUTER JOIN _table-ref join-spec_`
+
combines the results of both left and right outer joins. These joins show records from both tables and fill in NULLs for missing matches on
either side

* `_simple-table_`
+
A _simple-table_ can be specified as:
+
```
  VALUES (_row-value-const_) [,(_row-value-const_)]...
| TABLE _table_
| _query-specification_
```
+
A _simple-table_ can be a table value constructor. It starts with the VALUES keyword followed by a sequence of row
value constructors, each of which is enclosed in parentheses. A _row-value-const_ is a list of expressions (or NULL)
or a row subquery (a subquery that returns a single row of column values). An operand of an expression cannot reference
a column (except when the operand is a scalar subquery returning a single column value in its result table).
+
The use of NULL as a _row-value-const_ element is a {project-name} SQL extension.
+
A _simple-table_ can be specified by using the TABLE keyword followed by a table name, which is equivalent to the
query specification SELECT * FROM _table_.
+
A _simple-table_ can be a _query-specification_—that is, a SELECT statement consisting of SELECT &#8230; FROM &#8230; with
optionally the WHERE, SAMPLE, TRANSPOSE, SEQUENCE BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses.

* `WHERE _search-condition_`
+
specifies a _search-condition_ for selecting rows. See <<search_condition,Search Condition>>. The WHERE clause
cannot contain an aggregate (set) function.
+
The _search-condition_ is applied to each row of the result table derived from the table reference in the FROM clause
or, in the case of multiple table references, the cross-product of result tables derived from the individual table references.
+
Each column you specify in _search-condition_ is typically a column in this intermediate result table. In the case of nested
subqueries used to provide comparison values, the column can also be an outer reference. See<<subquery,Subquery>>.
+
To comply with ANSI standards, {project-name} SQL does not move aggregate predicates from the WHERE clause to a HAVING clause and
does not move non-aggregate predicates from the HAVING clause to the WHERE clause.

* `SAMPLE _sampling-method_`
+
specifies the sampling method used to select a subset of the intermediate result table of a SELECT statement. Each of the
methods uses a sampling size. The three sampling methods—random, first, and periodic—are specified as:

** `RANDOM _percent-size_`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to choose rows randomly (each row having an unbiased probability of being chosen) without replacement
from the result table. The sampling size is determined by using a percent of the result table.

** `FIRST _rows-size_ [SORT BY _colname_ [,_colname_]&#8230;]`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to choose the first _rows-size_ rows from the sorted result table. The sampling size is determined
by using the specified number of rows.

** `PERIODIC _rows-size_ EVERY _number-rows_ ROWS [SORT BY _colname_ [,_colname_] &#8230;]`
+
directs {project-name} SQL to choose the first rows from each block (period) of contiguous sorted rows. The sampling size is
determined by using the specified number of rows chosen from each block.

** SAMPLE is a {project-name} SQL extension. See <<sample_clause,SAMPLE Clause>>.

* `TRANSPOSE _transpose-set_[_transpose-set_]&#8230; [KEY BY _key-colname_]`
+
specifies the _transpose-sets_ and an optional key clause within a TRANSPOSE clause. You can use multiple TRANSPOSE
clauses in a SELECT statement.

** `_transpose-item-list_ AS _transpose-col-list_`
+
specifies a _transpose-set._ You can use multiple transpose sets within a TRANSPOSE clause. The TRANSPOSE clause generates,
for each row of the source table derived from the table reference or references in the FROM clause, a row for each item in
each _transpose-item-list_ of all the transpose sets.
+
The result table of a TRANSPOSE clause has all the columns of the source table plus a value column or columns, as specified
in each _transpose-col-list_ of all the transpose sets, and an optional key column _key-colname_.

** `KEY BY _key-colname_`
+
optionally specifies an optional key column _key-colname_. It identifies which expression the value in the transpose column
list corresponds to by its position in the _transpose-item-list_. _key-colname_ is an SQL identifier. The data type is exact
numeric, and the value is NOT NULL.

** TRANSPOSE is a {project-name} SQL extension. See <<transpose_clause,TRANSPOSE Clause>>.

* `SEQUENCE BY _colname_ [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]] [,_colname_ [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]] &#8230;`
+
specifies the order in which to sort the rows of the intermediate result table for calculating sequence functions. You must
include a SEQUENCE BY clause if you include a sequence function in _select-list_. Otherwise, {project-name} SQL returns an error.
Further, you cannot include a SEQUENCE BY clause if no sequence function is in _select-list_.

** `_colname_`
+
names a column in _select-list_ or a column in a table reference in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement. _colname_ is
optionally qualified by a table, view, or correlation name; for example, CUSTOMER.CITY.

** `ASC | DESC`
+
specifies the sort order. The default is ASC. When {project-name} SQL orders an intermediate result table on a column that can
contain null, nulls are considered equal to one another but greater than all other non-null values.

<<<
* `GROUP BY [_col-expr_] {_colname_ | _colnum_} [,{_colname_ | _colnum_}]&#8230;]`
+
specifies grouping columns that define a set of groups for the result table of the SELECT statement. The expression in the
GROUP BY clause must be exactly the same as the expression in the select list. These columns must appear in the list of
columns in the table references in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.
+
If you include a GROUP BY clause, the columns you refer to in the _select-list_ must be grouping columns or arguments of
an aggregate (or set) function.
+
The grouping columns define a set of groups in which each group consists of rows with identical values in the specified
columns. The column names can be qualified by a table or view name or a correlation name; for example, CUSTOMER.CITY.
+
For example, if you specify AGE, the result table contains one group of rows with AGE equal to 40 and one group of rows
with AGE equal to 50. If you specify AGE and then JOB, the result table contains one group for each age and, within each
age group, subgroups for each job code.
+
You can specify GROUP BY using ordinals to refer to the relative position within the SELECT list. For example, GROUP BY 3, 2, 1.
+
For grouping purposes, all nulls are considered equal to one another. The result table of a GROUP BY clause can have only
one null group. See <<considerations_for_group_by,Considerations for GROUP BY>>.

* `HAVING _search-condition_`
+
specifies a _search-condition_ to apply to each group of the grouped table resulting from the preceding GROUP BY clause
in the SELECT statement.
+
To comply with ANSI standards, {project-name} SQL does not move aggregate predicates from the WHERE clause to a HAVING clause
and does not move non-aggregate predicates from the HAVING clause to the WHERE clause.
+
If no GROUP BY clause exists, the _search-condition_ is applied to the entire table (which consists of one group) resulting
from the WHERE clause (or the FROM clause if no WHERE clause exists).
+
In _search-condition_, you can specify any column as the argument of an aggregate (or set) function; for example, AVG (SALARY).
An aggregate function is applied to each group in the grouped table.
+
A column that is not an argument of an aggregate function must be a grouping column. When you refer to a grouping column,
you are referring to a single value because each row in the group contains the same value in the grouping column.
See <<search_condition,Search Condition>>.

<<<
* `[FOR] _access-option_ ACCESS`
+
specifies the _access-option_ when accessing data specified by the SELECT statement or by a table reference in the FROM
clause derived from the evaluation of a query expression that is a SELECT statement.
See <<data_consistency_and_access_options,Data Consistency and Access Options>>.

* `READ COMMITTED`
+
specifies that any data accessed must be from committed rows.

* `UNION [ALL] _select-stmt_`
+
specifies a set union operation between the result table of a SELECT statement and the result table of another SELECT statement.
+
The result of the union operation is a table that consists of rows belonging to either of the two contributing tables. If
you specify UNION ALL, the table contains all the rows retrieved by each SELECT statement. Otherwise, duplicate rows are removed.
+
The select lists in the two SELECT statements of a union operation must have the same number of columns, and columns in
corresponding positions within the lists must have compatible data types. The select lists must not be preceded by
[ANY _N_] or [FIRST N].
+
The number of columns in the result table of the union operation is the same as the number of columns in each select list.
The column names in the result table of the union are the same as the corresponding names in the select list of the left
SELECT statement. A column resulting from the union of expressions or constants has the name (EXPR).
See <<considerations_for_union,Considerations for UNION>>.

* `_select-stmt_ INTERSECT _select-stmt_`
+
specifies a set intersect operation between the result table of a SELECT statement and the result table of another SELECT statement.
The result of the intersect operation is a table that consists of rows appear in both result sets.
+
The result of INTERSECT does not contain any duplicate rows.
+
The select lists in the two SELECT statements of an intersect operation must have the same number of columns, and columns in
corresponding positions within the lists must have compatible data types. The select lists must not be preceded by
[ANY _N_] or [FIRST N].

* `_select-stmt_ EXCEPT _select-stmt_`
+
specifies a set except operation between the result table of a SELECT statement and the result table of another SELECT statement.
The result of the except operation is a table that consists of rows that are in the result of the left SELECT statement but not in 
the result of the right one.
+
The result of EXCEPT does not contain any duplicate rows.
+
The select lists in the two SELECT statements of an except operation must have the same number of columns, and columns in
corresponding positions within the lists must have compatible data types. The select lists must not be preceded by
[ANY _N_] or [FIRST N].

* `ORDER BY {_colname_ | _colnum_} [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]] [,{_colname_ | _colnum_} [ASC[ENDING] | DESC[ENDING]]]&#8230;`
+
specifies the order in which to sort the rows of the final result table.

** `_colname_`
+
names a column in _select-list_ or a column in a table reference in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.
_colname_ is optionally qualified by a table, view, or correlation name; for example, CUSTOMER.CITY. If a
column has been aliased to another name you must use the alias name.

** `_colnum_`
+
specifies a column by its position in _select-list_. Use _colnum_ to refer to unnamed columns, such as derived columns.

** `ASC | DESC`
+
specifies the sort order. The default is ASC. For ordering a result table on a column that can contain null, nulls are
considered equal to one another but greater than all other non-null values.
+
See <<considerations_for_order_by,Considerations for ORDER BY>>.

* `LIMIT _num_`
+
limits the number of rows returned by the query with no limit applied if _num_ is null or less than zero. The LIMIT
clause is executed after the ORDER BY clause to support TopN queries.

[[select_considerations]]
=== Considerations for SELECT

[[select_authorization_requirements]]
==== Authorization Requirements

SELECT requires authority to read all views and tables referred to in the statement, including the underlying tables
of views referred to in the statement.

[[select_use_of_views_with_select]]
==== Use of Views With SELECT

When a view is referenced in a SELECT statement, the specification that defines the view is combined with the statement.
The combination can cause the SELECT statement to be invalid. If you receive an error message that indicates a problem
but the SELECT statement seems to be valid, check the view definition.

For example, suppose that the view named AVESAL includes column A defined as AVG (X). The SELECT statement that
contains MAX (A) in its select list is invalid because the select list actually contains MAX (AVG (X)), and an aggregate
function cannot have an argument that includes another aggregate function.

[[select_join_limits]]
==== Join Limits

NOTE: We recommend that you limit the number of tables in a join to a maximum of 64, which includes base tables of views
referenced in joins. Queries with joins that involve a larger number of tables are not guaranteed to compile.

[[select_object_names_in_select]]
==== Object Names in SELECT

You can use fully qualified names only in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement.

[[select_as_and_order_by_conflicts]]
==== AS and ORDER BY Conflicts

When you use the AS verb to rename a column in a SELECT statement, and the ORDER BY clause uses the original column name,
the query fails. If a column has been aliased to another name, you must use the alias name. The ANSI standard does not
support this type of query.

[[select_restrictions_on_embedded_inserts]]
==== Restrictions on Embedded Inserts

* An embedded INSERT cannot be used in a join.
* An embedded INSERT cannot appear in a subquery.
* An embedded INSERT statement cannot have a subquery in the WHERE clause.
* An INSERT statement cannot contain an embedded INSERT statement.
* A union between embedded INSERT expressions is not supported.
* Declaring a cursor on an embedded INSERT statement is not supported.

[[select_distinct_aggregate_functions]]
==== DISTINCT Aggregate Functions

An aggregate function can accept an argument specified as DISTINCT, which eliminates duplicate values before the aggregate
function is applied. For a given grouping, multiple DISTINCT aggregates are allowed and can be used with non distinct aggregates.
A restriction exists that DISTINCT STDDEV and VARIANCE cannot be used with multiple DISTINCT aggregates.

[[select_limitations_of_distinct_aggregates]]
==== Limitations of DISTINCT Aggregates

* No limit exists to the number of distinct aggregates.
* Distinct STDDEV and distinct VARIANCE are not supported with multiple distinct aggregates. For example, this statement will
result in an error.
+
```
SELECT sum(distinct a), stddev(distinct b) from T group by d;
```

<<<
[[select_examples_of_multiple_distinct_aggregates]]
==== Examples of Multiple Distinct Aggregates

* This statement contains distinct aggregates:
+
```

```

* This statement does not contain multiple distincts. Because each distinct aggregate is on the same column (a), this is
treated as one distinct value.
+
```
SELECT sum(distinct a), count(distinct a), avg(distinct a) from T group by d;
```

* This statement shows that multiple distinct aggregates can be used with non distinct aggregates:
+
```
SELECT sum(distinct a), avg(distinct b), sum(c) from T group by d;
```

[[select_considerations_for_with-clause]]
==== Considerations for with-clause

* Materialization of CTEs in temporary tables is not yet enabled by default. 

* Trafodion only supports non-recursive common table expressions, which means with-clause cannot be self-referencing, but it can reference a previously defined CTE within the same with-clause.

* The with-clause in Trafodion can be specified only once, at the beginning of a SELECT statement. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and CREATE VIEW statements are not supported yet.

[[select_considerations_for_select_list]]
==== Considerations for Select List

* The * and _corr_.* forms of a _select-list_ specification are convenient. However, such specifications make the order
of columns in the SELECT result table dependent on the order of columns in the current definition of the referenced tables
or views.
* A _col-expr_ is a single column name or a derived column. A derived column is an SQL value expression; its operands can
be numeric, string, datetime, or interval literals, columns, functions (including aggregate unctions) defined on columns,
scalar subqueries, CASE expressions, or CAST expressions. Any single columns named in _col-expr_ must be from tables or views
specified in the FROM clause. For a list of aggregate functions, see <<aggregate_functions,Aggregate (Set) Functions>>.
* If _col-expr_ is a single column name, that column of the SELECT result table is a named column. All other columns are
unnamed columns in the result table (and have the (EXPR) heading) unless you use the AS clause to specify a name for a
derived column.


[[select_considerations_for_group_by]]
==== Considerations for GROUP BY

* If you include a GROUP BY clause, the columns you refer to in the _select-list_ must be either grouping columns or
arguments of an aggregate (or set) function. For example, if AGE is not a grouping column, you can refer to AGE only
as the argument of a function, such as AVG (AGE).
* The expression in the GROUP BY clause must be exactly the same as the expression in the select list. An error will
be returned if it is not. It cannot contain aggregate functions or subqueries.
* If the value of _col-expr_ is a numeric constant, it refers to the position of the select list item and is treated
as the current GROUP BY using the ordinal feature.
* You can specify GROUP BY using ordinals to refer to the relative position within the SELECT list. For example,
GROUP BY 3, 2, 1.
* If you do not include a GROUP BY clause but you specify an aggregate function in the _select-list_, all rows of the
result table form the one and only group. The result of AVG, for example, is a single value for the entire table.

[[select_considerations_for_order_by]]
==== Considerations for ORDER BY

When you specify an ORDER BY clause and its ordering columns, consider:

* ORDER BY is allowed only in the outer level of a query or in the SELECT part of an INSERT/SELECT statement. It is not
allowed inside nested SELECT expressions, such as subqueries.
* If you specify DISTINCT, the ordering column must be in _select-list_.
* If you specify a GROUP BY clause, the ordering column must also be a grouping column.
* If an ORDER BY clause applies to a union of SELECT statements, the ordering column must be explicitly referenced, and
not within an aggregate function or an expression, in the _select-list_ of the leftmost SELECT statement.
* SQL does not guarantee a specific or consistent order of rows unless you specify an ORDER BY clause. ORDER BY can
reduce performance, however, so use it only if you require a specific order.

==== Considerations for UNION

Suppose that the contributing SELECT statements are named SELECT1 and SELECT2, the contributing tables resulting from
the SELECT statements are named TABLE1 and TABLE2, and the table resulting from the UNION operation is named RESULT.

[[select_characteristics_of_the_union_columns]]
===== Characteristics of the UNION Columns

For columns in TABLE1 and TABLE2 that contribute to the RESULT table:

* If both columns contain character strings, the corresponding column in RESULT contains a character string whose length
is equal to the greater of the two contributing columns.
* If both columns contain variable-length character strings, RESULT contains a variable-length character string whose
length is equal to the greater of the two contributing columns.
* If both columns are of exact numeric data types, RESULT contains an exact numeric value whose precision and scale are
equal to the greater of the two contributing columns.
* If both columns are of approximate numeric data types, RESULT contains an approximate numeric value whose precision is
equal to the greater of the two contributing columns.
* If both columns are of datetime data type (DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP), the corresponding column in RESULT has the same data type.
* If both columns are INTERVAL data type and both columns are year-month or day-time, RESULT contains an INTERVAL value
whose range of fields is the most significant start field to the least significant end field of the INTERVAL fields in the
contributing columns. (The year-month fields are YEAR and MONTH. The day-time fields are DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, and SECOND.)
+
For example, suppose that the column in TABLE1 has the data type INTERVAL HOUR TO MINUTE, and the column in TABLE2 has the
data type INTERVAL DAY TO HOUR. The data type of the column resulting from the union operation is INTERVAL DAY TO MINUTE.

* If both columns are described with NOT NULL, the corresponding column of RESULT cannot be null. Otherwise, the column can be null.

[[select_order_by_clause_and_the_union_operator]]
===== ORDER BY Clause and the UNION Operator

In a query containing a UNION operator, the ORDER BY clause defines an ordering on the result of the union. In this case,
the SELECT statement cannot have an individual ORDER BY clause.

You can specify an ORDER BY clause only as the last clause following the final SELECT statement (SELECT2 in this example).
The ORDER BY clause in RESULT specifies the ordinal position of the sort column either by using an integer or by using the
column name from the select list of SELECT1.

* This SELECT statement shows correct use of the ORDER BY clause:
+
```
SELECT A FROM T1 UNION SELECT B FROM T2 ORDER BY A
```

* This SELECT statement is incorrect because the ORDER BY clause does not follow the final SELECT statement:
+
```
SELECT A FROM T1 ORDER BY A UNION SELECT B FROM T2
```

<<<
* This SELECT statement is also incorrect:
+
```
SELECT A FROM T1 UNION (SELECT B FROM T2 ORDER BY A)
```
+
Because the subquery (SELECT B FROM T2&#8230;) is processed first, the ORDER BY clause does not follow the final SELECT.

[[select_group_by_clause_having_clause_and_the_union_operator]]
===== GROUP BY Clause, HAVING Clause, and the UNION Operator

In a query containing a UNION operator, the GROUP BY or HAVING clause is associated with the SELECT statement it is a
part of (unlike the ORDER BY clause, which can be associated with the result of a union operation). The groups are visible
in the result table of the particular SELECT statement. The GROUP BY and HAVING clauses cannot be used to form groups in
the result of a union operation.

[[select_union_all_and_associativity]]
===== UNION ALL and Associativity

The UNION ALL operation is left associative, meaning that these two queries return the same result:

```
(SELECT * FROM TABLE1 UNION ALL

SELECT * FROM TABLE2) UNION ALL SELECT * FROM TABLE3;

SELECT * FROM TABLE1 UNION ALL

(SELECT * FROM TABLE2 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM TABLE3);
```

If both the UNION ALL and UNION operators are present in the query, the order of evaluation is always from left to right.
A parenthesized union of SELECT statements is evaluated first, from left to right, followed by the remaining union of SELECT statements.

This type of condition is sometimes called a join predicate. The query first joins the EMPLOYEE and JOB tables by
combining each row of the EMPLOYEE table with each row of the JOB table; the intermediate result is the Cartesian

result table. The WHERE condition further specifies that the job code must be 900, 300, or 420. All other rows
are eliminated.

[[set_schema_statement]]
== SET SCHEMA Statement

The SET SCHEMA statement sets the default logical schema for unqualified object names for the current SQL session.

```
SET SCHEMA default-schema-name
```

[[set_schema_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of SET SCHEMA

* `_default-schema-name_`
+
specifies the name of a schema. See <<schemas,Schemas>>.
+
_default-schema-name_ is an SQL identifier. For example, you can use
MYSCHEMA or myschema or a delimited identifier "My_Schema". See <<identifiers,Identifiers>>.

[[set_schema_considerations]]
=== Considerations for SET SCHEMA

The default schema you specify with SET SCHEMA remains in effect until the end of the session or until you execute
another SET SCHEMA statement. If you do not set a schema name for the session using SET SCHEMA, the default schema
is SEABASE, which exists in the TRAFODION catalog.

For information on how to create a schema, see <<creating_and_dropping_schemas,Creating and Dropping Schemas>>.

[[set_transaction_statement]]
== SET TRANSACTION Statement

The SET TRANSACTION statement sets the autocommit attribute for transactions. It stays in effect until the end of
the session or until the next SET TRANSACTION statement, whichever comes first. Therefore, the SET TRANSACTION statement
can set the autocommit attribute of all subsequent transactions in the session.

```
SET TRANSACTION autocommit-option

autocommit-option is:
    AUTOCOMMIT [ON] | AUTOCOMMIT OFF
```

[[set_transaction_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of SET TRANSACTION

* `_autocommit-option_`
+
specifies whether {project-name} SQL commits or rolls back automatically at the end of statement execution. This option
applies to any statement for which the system initiates a transaction.
+
If this option is set to ON, {project-name} SQL automatically commits any changes or rolls back any changes made to the
database at the end of statement execution. AUTOCOMMIT is on by default at the start of a session.
+
If this option is set to OFF, the current transaction remains active until the end of the session unless you explicitly
commit or rollback the transaction. AUTOCOMMIT is a {project-name} SQL extension; you cannot use in it with any other option.
+
Using the AUTOCOMMIT option in a SET TRANSACTION statement does not reset other transaction attributes that may have
been specified in a previous SET TRANSACTION statement. Similarly, a SET TRANSACTION statement that does not specify
the AUTOCOMMIT attribute does not reset this attribute.

[[set_transaction_consideration]]
=== Considerations for SET TRANSACTION

[[set_transaction_implicit_transactions]]
==== Implicit Transactions

Most DML statements are transaction initiating—the system automatically initiates a transaction when the statement
begins executing.

<<<
The exceptions (statements that are not transaction initiating) are:

* COMMIT, FETCH, ROLLBACK, and SET TRANSACTION
* EXECUTE, which is transaction initiating only if the associated statement is transaction-initiating

[[set_transaction_explicit_transactions]]
==== Explicit Transactions

You can issue an explicit BEGIN WORK even if the autocommit option is on. The autocommit option is temporarily disabled
until you explicitly issue COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

[[set_transaction_examples]]
=== Examples of SET TRANSACTION

* The following SET TRANSACTION statement turns off autocommit so that the current transaction remains active until the
end of the session unless you explicitly commit or rollback the transaction. {project-name} SQL does not automatically commit
or roll back any changes made to the database at the end of statement execution. Instead, {project-name} SQL commits all the
changes when you issue the COMMIT WORK statement.

SHOWCONTROL is a {project-name} SQL extension.

```
SHOWCONTROL {ALL | [QUERY] DEFAULT [attribute-name[, MATCH {FULL | PARTIAL }]]}
```

[[showcontrol_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of SHOWCONTROL

* `ALL`
+
displays all the hard-coded default attributes that have been set for the {project-name} instance.

* `[QUERY] DEFAULT`
+
displays the CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT statements in effect for the session. For more information,
see the <<control_query default_statement,Control Query Default Statement>>.

* `_attribute-name_[, MATCH {FULL | PARTIAL }]`
+
displays only the defaults that match, either fully or partially, the _attribute_ used in CONTROL QUERY DEFAULT
statements. The match is not case-sensitive. For descriptions of these attributes, see the
{docs-url}/cqd_reference/index.html[{project-name} Control Query Default (CQD) Reference Guide].
+
MATCH FULL specifies that _attribute-name_ must be the same as the attribute name used in a control query default
statement. match partial specifies that _attribute-name_ must be included in the attribute name used in a control
query default statement. the default is match partial.
+
If _attribute-name_ is a reserved word, such as MIN, MAX, or TIME, you must capitalize _attribute-name_ and delimit
it within double quotes ("). The only exceptions to this rule are the reserved words CATALOG and SCHEMA, which you
can either capitalize and delimit within double quotes or specify without quotation marks.

```

[[showddl_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of SHOWDDL

* `[_schema-name_.]_object-name_`
+
specifies the ANSI name of an existing table, view, library, or procedure.
See <<database_object_names,Database Object Names>>. If _object-name_ is not fully qualified, SHOWDDL
uses the default schema for the session.

* `PRIVILEGES`
+
describes the PRIVILEGES associated with the object. If specified, privileges are displayed for an object
in the form of GRANT statements.

* `_component-name_`
+
specifies an existing component. Currently, the only valid component name is SQL_OPERATIONS.

* `_database-username_`
+
specifies a registered database username.

* `_role-name_`
+
specifies an existing role.

* `GRANTEES`
+
displays all users who have been granted the role in the form of GRANT ROLE statements. This is an optional clause.

[[showddl_considerations]]
=== Considerations for SHOWDDL

* SHOWDDL can differ from the original DDL used to create an object.
* SHOWDDL can be used within TrafCI.
* SHOWDDL [TABLE \| LIBRARY \| PROCEDURE] displays the following information:
** A constraint may be disabled.
** A table may be off line.
** An active DDL lock may exist on an object.
* SHOWDDL USER displays user information as a REGISTER USER statement.
* SHOWDDL ROLE displays the role information as a CREATE ROLE statement.

[[showddl_required_privileges]]
==== Required Privileges

To issue a SHOWDDL statement, one of the following must be true:

* You are DB ROOT.
* You are the owner of the database object.
* You have the SHOW component privilege for the SQL_OPERATIONS component.
The SHOW component privilege is granted to PUBLIC by default.
* You have the SELECT privilege on the target object.

[[showddl_differences_between_showddl_output_and_original_ddl]]
==== Differences Between SHOWDDL Output and Original DDL

* All column constraints (NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, and CHECK) are transformed into table constraints.
All NOT NULL constraints are consolidated into a single check constraint.
* Check constraints are moved out of the CREATE TABLE statement and encapsulated in a separate ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT
statement.
* SHOWDDL generates ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN statements for each column that was added to the table.
* All ANSI names in the output are qualified with the schema name.
* SHOWDDL displays constraint names even though they might not have been specified during the creation of the constraint.
* SHOWDDL always generates a Java signature for the SPJ.

[[showddl_privileges_option]]
==== PRIVILEGES Option

The PRIVILEGES option includes the GRANT statements as they apply to the option. Each privilege is specified in
separate GRANT statements even if they were granted in a single statement.

== SHOWSTATS Statement

The SHOWSTATS statement displays the histogram statistics for one or
more groups of columns within a table. These statistics are used to
devise optimized access plans.

SHOWSTATS is a {project-name} SQL extension.

```
SHOWSTATS FOR TABLE table-name ON group-list [DETAIL]

group-list is:

  | column-name TO column-name
  | (column-name) TO (column-name)
  | column-name TO (column-name)
  | (column-name) TO column-name

column-list for a multicolumn group is:
    (column-name, column-name[, column-name]...)
```

[[showstats_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of SHOWSTATS

* `_table-name_`
+
is the ANSI name of the table for which statistics are to be displayed.

* `ON _group-list_`
+
specifies one or more groups of columns, _group-list_, for which to display histogram statistics.

* `_group-list_ is: _column-list_ [, _column-list_]&#8230; | EVERY COLUMN [,_column-list_]&#8230; | EVERY KEY [, _column-list_]&#8230; | EXISTING
COLUMN[S] [, _column-list_]&#8230;`
+
specifies the ways in which _group-list_ can be defined. The column list represents both a single-column group and a
multi-column group.

<<<
** `EVERY COLUMN`
+
indicates that histogram statistics are to be displayed for each individual column of _table_ and any multi columns that
make up the primary key and indexes. For columns that do not have histograms, this option returns
`No histogram data for column(s) ---&#93;`.

** `EVERY KEY`
+
indicates that histogram statistics are to be displayed for columns that make up the primary key and indexes.

** `EXISTING COLUMN[S]`
+
indicates that histogram statistics are to be displayed only for columns of _table_ that actually have histograms.
This option yields a more concise report because columns with no histogram data are omitted. This option includes
any existing multicolumn histograms.

** `DETAIL`
+
displays statistics for corresponding histogram intervals and other details.
+
If you do not select the DETAIL keyword, the default display lists the basic histogram information, including the
histogram ID, number of intervals, total rows, total UEC, and the column names. The detailed display additionally
includes the low value and high value as well as interval data.

* `_column-list_ for a single-column group is: _column-name_ |
(_column-name_) | _column-name_ TO _column-name_ | (_column-name_)
TO (_column-name_) | _column-name_ TO (_column-name_) |
(_column-name_) TO _column-name_`
+
specifies the ways in which the _column-name_ can be defined for single-column groups. A range of columns specified
using the TO keyword causes all columns in that range to be included, defined by their order of declaration in the table.

* `_column-list_ for a multicolumn group is: (_column-name, column-name_[,_column-name_]&#8230;)`
+
specifies the ways in which the _column-name_ can be defined for multicolumn groups. For example, (abc, def) indicates
the multicolumn histogram consisting of columns abc and def, not two single-column histograms.

names a column in _table_ to update. You cannot qualify or repeat a
column name. You cannot update the value of a column that is part of the
primary key.

** `_expression_`
+
is an SQL value expression that specifies a value for the column. The
_expression_ cannot contain an aggregate function defined on a column.
The data type of _expression_ must be compatible with the data type of
_column-name_.
+
If _expression_ refers to columns being updated, {project-name} SQL uses the
original values to evaluate the expression and determine the new value.
See <<expressions,Expressions>>.

** `NULL`
+
can also specify the value of the update source.

* `_set-clause-type2_`
+
This type of SET clause allows multiple columns to be specified on the
left side of the assignment operator. These columns are updated using
multiple values specified on the right side of the assignment operator.
The right side of the assignment operator could be simple values or a
subquery.

** `_column1_, &#8230;, _columnN_`
+
names columns in _table_ to update. You cannot qualify or repeat a
column name. You cannot update the value of a column that is part of the
primary key.

** `_value1_, &#8230;, _valueN_`
+
are values specified on the right side of the assignment operator for
the columns specified on the left side of the assignment operator. The
data type of each value must be compatible with the data type of the
corresponding column on the left side of the assignment operator.

* `_query-expr_`
+
is a SELECT subquery. Only one subquery can be specified on the right
side of a SET clause. The subquery cannot refer to the table being
updated. For the syntax and description of _query-expr_, see the
<<select_statement,SELECT Statement>>.

* `WHERE _search-condition_`
+
specifies a _search-condition_ that selects rows to update. Within the
_search-condition_, columns being compared are also being updated in
the table or view. See <<search_condition,Search Condition>>.
+
If you do not specify a _search-condition_, all rows in the table or
view are updated.
+
<<<
+
Do not use an UPDATE statement with a WHERE clause that contains a
SELECT for the same table. Reading from and inserting into, updating in,
or deleting from the same table generates an error. Use a positioned
(WHERE CURRENT OF) UPDATE instead. See <<merge_statement,MERGE Statement>>.

* `[FOR] _access-option_ ACCESS`
+
specifies the _access-option_ required for data used in the evaluation
of a search condition. See <<data_consistency_and_access_options,
Data Consistency and Access Options>>.

* `READ COMMITTED`
+
specifies that any data used in the evaluation of the search condition
must be from committed rows.

[[update_considerations]]
=== Considerations for UPDATE

[[update_performance]]
==== Performance

An UPDATE of primary key columns could perform poorly when compared to
an UPDATE of non-key columns. This is because the UPDATE operation
involves moving records in disk by deleting all the records in the
before-image and then inserting the records in the after-image back into
the table.

[[update_authorization_requirements]]
==== Authorization Requirements

UPDATE requires authority to read and write to the table or view being
updated and authority to read any table or view specified in subqueries
used in the search condition. A column of a view can be updated if its
underlying column in the base table can be updated.

[[update_transaction_initiation_and_termination]]
==== Transaction Initiation and Termination

The UPDATE statement automatically initiates a transaction if no active
transaction exists. Otherwise, you can explicitly initiate a transaction
with the BEGIN WORK statement. When a transaction is started, the SQL
statements execute within that transaction until a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is
encountered or an error occurs.

[[update_isolation_levels_of_transactions_and_access_options_of_statements]]
==== Isolation Levels of Transactions and Access Options of Statements

The isolation level of a {project-name} SQL transaction defines the degree to
which the operations on data within that transaction are affected by
operations of concurrent transactions. When you specify
access options for the DML statements within a transaction, you override
the isolation level of the containing transaction. Each statement then
executes with its individual access option.

[[update_conflicting_updates_in_concurrent_applications]]
==== Conflicting Updates in Concurrent Applications

If you are using the READ COMMITTED isolation level within a
transaction, your application can read different committed values for
the same data at different times. Further, two concurrent applications
can update (possibly in error) the same column in the same row.

[[update_requirements_for_data_in_row]]
==== Requirements for Data in Row

Each row to be updated must satisfy the constraints of the table or
underlying base table of the view. No column updates can occur unless
all of these constraints are satisfied. (A table constraint is satisfied
if the check condition is not false—that is, it is either true or has an
unknown value.)

In addition, a candidate row from a view created with the WITH CHECK
OPTION must satisfy the view selection criteria. The selection criteria
are specified in the WHERE clause of the AS _query-expr_ clause in the
CREATE VIEW statement.

[[update_reporting_of_updates]]
==== Reporting of Updates

When an UPDATE completes successfully, {project-name} SQL reports the number
of times rows were updated during the operation.

Under certain conditions, updating a table with indexes can cause
{project-name} SQL to update the same row more than once, causing the number
of reported updates to be higher than the actual number of changed rows.
However, both the data in the table and the number of reported updates
are correct. This behavior occurs when all of these conditions are true:

* The optimizer chooses an alternate index as the access path.
* The index columns specified in WHERE _search-condition_ are not changed by the update.
* Another column within the same index is updated to a higher value (if
that column is stored in ascending order), or a lower value (if that
column is stored in descending order).

When these conditions occur, the order of the index entries ensures that
{project-name} SQL will encounter the same row (satisfying the same
_search-condition)_ at a later time during the processing of the table.
The row is then updated again by using the same value or values.

For example, suppose that the index of MYTABLE consists of columns A and
B, and the UPDATE statement is specified:

```
UPDATE MYTABLE SET B = 20 WHERE A > 10;
```

If the contents of columns A and B are 1 and 12 respectively before the
UPDATE, after the UPDATE {project-name} SQL will encounter the same row
indexed by the values 1 and 20.

[[update_updating_character_values]]
==== Updating Character Values

For a fixed-length character column, an update value shorter than the
column length is padded with single-byte ASCII blanks (HEX20) to fill
the column. If the update value is longer than the column length, string
truncation of non blank trailing characters returns an error, and the
column is not updated.

For a variable-length character column, an update value is not padded;
its length is the length of the value specified. As is the case for
fixed length, if the update value is longer than the column length,
string truncation of non blank trailing characters returns an error, and
the column is not updated.

[[update_set_clause_restrictions_and_error_cases]]
==== SET Clause Restrictions and Error Cases

The SET clause has the following restrictions:

* The number of columns on the left side of each assignment operator
should match the number of values or SELECT list elements on the right
side. The following examples are not allowed:
+
```
UPDATE t SET (a,b)=(10,20,30)

UPDATE t set (b,c)=(SELECT r,t,s FROM x)
```

* If multi-column update syntax is specified and the right side contains
a subquery, only one element, the subquery, is not allowed.
+
```
UPDATE t SET (a,b)=(10, (SELECT a FROM t1))
```

* More than one subquery is not allowed if multiple-column syntax is
used.
+
```
UPDATE t SET (a,b)=(SELECT x,y FROM z), (c,d)=(SELECT x,y FROM a))
```

* If a subquery is used, it must return at most one row.

<<<
[[update_examples]]
=== Examples of UPDATE

* Update a single row of the ORDERS table that contains information
about order number 200300 and change the delivery date:
+
```
UPDATE sales.orders
SET deliv_date = DATE '2008-05-02'
WHERE ordernum = 200300;
```

* Update several rows of the CUSTOMER table:
+
```
UPDATE sales.customer SET credit = 'A1'
WHERE custnum IN (21, 3333, 324);
```

* Update all rows of the CUSTOMER table to the default credit 'C1':
+
```
UPDATE sales.customer SET credit = 'C1';
```

* Update the salary of each employee working for all departments located
in Chicago:
+
```
UPDATE persnl.employee
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE deptnum IN
   (SELECT deptnum FROM persnl.dept
    WHERE location = 'CHICAGO');
```
+
The subquery is evaluated for each row of the DEPT table and returns
department numbers for departments located in Chicago.

* This is an example of a self-referencing UPDATE statement, where the
table being updated is scanned in a subquery:
+
```
UPDATE table3 SET b = b + 2000 WHERE a, b =
(SELECT a, b FROM table3 WHERE b > 200);
```

<<<
[[upsert_statement]]
== UPSERT Statement

The UPSERT statement either updates a table if the row exists or inserts
into a table if the row does not exist.

UPSERT is a {project-name} SQL extension.

```
UPSERT [USING LOAD] INTO table [(target-col-list)] {query-expr | values-clause}

target-col-list is:
    column-name[, column-name]...

values-clause is:
    VALUES ( expression[, expression]... )
```

[[upsert_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of UPSERT

* `USING LOAD`
+
allows the UPSERT to occur without a transaction. Use this clause when
inserting data into an empty table. If you do not specify this clause,
the UPSERT occurs within a transaction.

* `_table_`
+
names the user table in which to insert or update rows. _table_ must be
a base table. 

*`_target-col-list_`
+
names the columns in the table in which to insert or update values. The
data type of each target column must be compatible with the data type of its corresponding source
value. Within the list, each target column must have the same position
as its associated source value, whose position is determined by the
columns in the table derived from the evaluation of the query expression
(`_query-expr_`).
+
If you do not specify all of the columns in the target _table_ in the
`_target-col-list_`, column default values are inserted into or updated
in the columns that do not appear in the list. See
<<column_default_settings,Column Default Settings>>.
+
If you do not specify `_target-col-list_`, row values from the source
table are inserted into or updated in all columns in table. The order of
the column values in the source table must be the same order as that of
the columns specified in the CREATE TABLE for _table_. (This order is
the same as that of the columns listed in the result table of SHOWDDL
_table_.)

* `_column-name_`
+
names a column in the target _table_ in which to either insert or update
data. You cannot qualify or repeat a column name.

* `_query-expr_`
+
is a SELECT subquery that returns data to be inserted into or updated in
the target _table_. The subquery cannot refer to the table being
operated on. For the syntax and description of _query-expr_, see the
<<select_statement,SELECT Statement>>.

* `VALUES ( _expression_[, _expression_]&#8230; )`
+
specifies an SQL value expression or a set of expressions that specify
values to be inserted into or updated in the target _table_. The data
type of _expression_ must be compatible with the data type of the
corresponding column in the target _table_. See
<<expressions,Expressions>>.

[[upsert_examples]]
=== Examples of UPSERT

* This UPSERT statement inserts 1,000,000 rows from _source_table_ into _target_table_.

<<<
[[values_statement]]
== VALUES Statement

The VALUES statements starts with the VALUES keyword followed by a
sequence of row value constructors, each of which is enclosed in
parenthesis. It displays the results of the evaluation of the
expressions and the results of row subqueries within the row value
constructors.

```
VALUES (row-value-const) [, (row-value-const)]...

row-value-const is:
    row-subquery
  | {expression | NULL} [,{expression | NULL}...
```

[[values_syntax]]
=== Syntax Description of VALUES

* `_row-value-const_`
+
specifies a list of expressions (or NULL) or a row subquery (a subquery
that returns a single row of column values). An operand of an expression
cannot reference a column (except when the operand is a scalar subquery
returning a single column value in its result table).
+
The results of the evaluation of the expressions and the results of the
row subqueries in the row value constructors must have compatible data
types.

[[values_considerations]]
=== Considerations for VALUES

[[values_relationship_to_select_statement]]
==== Relationship to SELECT Statement

The result of the VALUES statement is one form of a _simple-table_,
which is part of the definition of a table reference within a SELECT
statement. See the <<select statement,SELECT Statement>>.

[[values_relationship_to_insert_statement]]
==== Relationship to INSERT Statement

For a VALUES clause that is the direct source of an INSERT statement,
{project-name} SQL also allows the keyword DEFAULT in a VALUES clause, just
like NULL is allowed. For more information, see the
<<insert statement,INSERT Statement>>.

<<<
[[values_examples]]
=== Examples of VALUES

* This VALUES statement displays two rows with simple constants:

     1      2     3
     4      5     6

--- 2 row(s) selected.
