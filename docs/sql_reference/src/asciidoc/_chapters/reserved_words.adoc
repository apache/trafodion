= Reserved Words
The words listed in this appendix are reserved for use by Trafodion SQL.
To prevent syntax errors, avoid using these words as identifiers in
Trafodion SQL. In Trafodion SQL, if an operating system name contains a
reserved word, you must enclose the reserved word in double quotes (")
to access that column or object.

NOTE: In Trafodion SQL, ABSOLUTE, DATA, EVERY, INITIALIZE, OPERATION,
PATH, SPACE, STATE, STATEMENT, STATIC, and START are not reserved words.

Trafodion SQL treats these words as reserved when they are part of
Trafodion SQL stored text. They cannot be used as identifiers unless you
enclose them in double quotes.
