[[execute-spjs]]
= Execute SPJs

This chapter describes how to execute SPJs by using the CALL statement
and assumes that you have already registered the SPJs in {project-name}
and that you have granted privileges to execute the SPJs to the
appropriate database users. For information, see
<<deploy-spj-jar-files, Deploy SPJ JAR Files>>
and <<create-spjs, Create SPJs>>.

This chapter covers these topics:

The CALL statement invokes an SPJ in the database. You can issue a CALL
statement from any of these applications or interfaces supported by {project-name}:

* trafci command-line interface or script file
* JDBC Type-4 client applications
* ODBC client applications

You can use a CALL statement as a stand-alone SQL statement in
applications or in command-line interfaces, such as trafci. You can also
use a CALL statement in a trigger but not inside a compound statement or
with rowsets. The SPJ that you use in a trigger must not have any OUT or
INOUT parameters or return any result sets.

<<<
[[required-privileges-for-calling-an-spj]]
== Required Privileges for Calling an SPJ

To execute the CALL statement, you must have the EXECUTE privilege on
the procedure. For more information, see
<<grant-privileges, Grant Privileges>>.

[[transaction-behavior]]
== Transaction Behavior

The stored procedure's transaction attribute determines whether it
inherits the transaction from the calling application (TRANSACTION
REQUIRED) or whether it runs without inheriting the calling
application's transaction (NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED). The transaction
attribute is set during the creation of the stored procedure. For more
information, see the Transaction Required attribute in
<<create-a-procedure, Create a Procedure>>.

Typically, you want the stored procedure to inherit the transaction
from the calling application. See <<transaction-required, Transaction Required>>.
However, if the SPJ method does not access the database or if you want the
stored procedure to manage its own transactions, you should set the stored
procedure's transaction attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED.
See <<no-transaction-required>>.

[[transaction-required]]
=== Transaction Required

If you want the SPJ method to inherit the transaction from the calling
application, set the stored procedure's transaction attribute to
TRANSACTION REQUIRED (the default setting) when creating the stored
procedure. For more information, see the Transaction Required attribute
in <<create-a-procedure, Create a Procedure>>. When a stored procedure's
transaction attribute is TRANSACTION REQUIRED, a CALL statement
automatically initiates a transaction if there is no active transaction.

[[using-transaction-control-statements-or-methods]]
==== Using Transaction Control Statements or Methods

If you select `Yes` for the Transaction Required attribute when creating a
stored procedure, then you should not use transaction control statements (or
equivalent JDBC transaction methods) in the SPJ method. Transaction
control statements include COMMIT WORK and ROLLBACK WORK, and the
equivalent JDBC transaction methods are `Connection.commit()` and
`Connection.rollback()`.

If you try to use transaction control statements or methods in an SPJ method
when the stored procedure's transaction attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED,
then the transaction control statements or methods in the SPJ method are ignored
and the Java virtual machine (JVM) does not report any errors or warnings.

When the stored procedure's transaction attribute is set to TRANSACTION REQUIRED,
then you should rely on the transaction control statements or methods in the
application that calls the stored procedure and allow the calling
application to manage the transactions.

[[committing-or-rolling-back-a-transaction]]
===== Committing or Rolling Back a Transaction

If you do not use transaction control statements in the calling
application, then the transaction initiated by the CALL statement might not
automatically commit or roll back changes to the database.

When AUTOCOMMIT is ON (the default setting), then the database engine
automatically commits or rolls back any changes made to the database at
the end of the CALL statement execution. However, when AUTOCOMMIT is
OFF, the current transaction remains active until the end of the client
session or until you explicitly commit or roll back the transaction.

To ensure an atomic unit of work when calling an SPJ, use the COMMIT
WORK statement in the calling application to commit the transaction when
the CALL statement succeeds, and use the ROLLBACK WORK statement to roll
back the transaction when the CALL statement fails. For more information
about transaction management, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual].

[[no-transaction-required]]
=== No Transaction Required

In some cases, you might not want the SPJ method to inherit the
transaction from the calling application. Instead, you might want the
stored procedure to manage its own transactions or to run without a
transaction. Not inheriting the calling application's transaction is
useful in these cases:

* The stored procedure performs several long-running operations, such as
multiple DDL or table maintenance operations, on the database. In this
case, you might want to commit those operations periodically from within
the SPJ method to avoid locking tables for a long time.

* The stored procedure performs certain SQL operations that must run
without an active transaction. For example, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
statements with the WITH NO ROLLBACK option are rejected when a
transaction is already active, as is the case when a stored procedure
inherits a transaction from the calling application. The PURGEDATA
utility is also rejected when a transaction is already active.

* The stored procedure does not access the database. (For an example,
see the <<totalprice-procedure, TOTALPRICE Procedure>>.) In this case,
the stored procedure does not need to inherit the transaction from the
calling application. By setting the stored procedure's transaction
attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED, you can avoid the overhead of
the calling application's transaction being propagated to the stored
procedure.

In these cases, you should set the stored procedure's transaction
attribute to NO TRANSACTION REQUIRED when creating the stored procedure.
For more information, see the Transaction Required attribute in
<<create-a-procedure, Create a Procedure>>.

<<<
If you select `No` for the Transaction Required attribute when creating a
stored procedure and if the SPJ method creates a JDBC default
connection, then that connection has autocommit enabled by default. You
can either use the autocommit transactions or disable autocommit
(`conn.setAutoCommit(false);`) and use the JDBC transaction methods,
`Connection.commit()` and `Connection.rollback()`, to commit or roll back
work where needed.

[[multithreading]]
== Multithreading

{project-name} manages a single thread of execution within
an SPJ environment, even if the application that issues a CALL statement
is a multi-threaded Java application.

The CALL statements in a multi-threaded application can execute in a nonblocking manner,
but the SPJ methods underlying those CALL statements execute serially within a
given SPJ environment.

[[using-the-call-statement]]
== Using the CALL Statement

To invoke a stored procedure, specify the name of the stored procedure
and its arguments in a CALL statement, as shown in the figure below.

.CALL Statement Elements
image:{images}/call-statement-elements.jpg[CALL Statement Elements]

For the syntax of the CALL statement, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#call_statement[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual].

<<<
[[specifying-the-name-of-the-spj]]
=== Specifying the Name of the SPJ

In the CALL statement, specify the name of an SPJ that you have already
created in the database. Qualify the procedure name with the same
catalog and schema that you specified when you registered the SPJ. For
example:

[source, sql]
----
CALL trafodion.persnl.adjustsalary( 202, 5.5, ? ) ;
----

Or, for example:

[source, sql]
----
SET SCHEMA trafodion.persnl ;

CALL adjustsalary( 202, 5.5, ? ) ;
----

If you do not fully qualify the procedure name, then the database engine
qualifies the procedure according to the catalog and schema of the
current session.

[[listing-the-parameter-arguments-of-the-spj]]
=== Listing the Parameter Arguments of the SPJ

Each argument that you list in the CALL statement must correspond to an
SQL parameter of the SPJ. A result set in the Java signature of the SPJ
method does not correspond to an SQL parameter. Do not specify result
sets in the argument list.

For example, if you registered the stored procedure with three SQL
parameters (two IN parameters and one OUT parameter), then you must
list three formal parameter arguments, separated by commas, in the
CALL statement:

[source, sql]
----
CALL trafodion.persnl.adjustsalary( 202, 5, ? ) ;
----

If the SPJ does not accept arguments, you must specify empty
parentheses, as shown below:

[source, sql]
----
CALL trafodion.sales.lowerprice() ;
----

If the SPJ has one IN parameter, one OUT parameter, and two result sets,
you must list the IN and OUT parameters but not the result sets in the
argument list:

```
CALL trafodion.sales.ordersummary('01-01-2011', ?);
```

[[data-conversion-of-parameter-arguments]]
==== Data Conversion of Parameter Arguments

The database engine performs an implicit data conversion when the data
type of a parameter argument is compatible with but does not match the
formal data type of the stored procedure.

For stored procedure input values, the conversion is from the actual
argument value to the formal parameter type.

For stored procedure output values, the conversion is from the actual
output value, which has the data type of the formal parameter, to the
declared type of the dynamic parameter.

[[input-parameter-arguments]]
==== Input Parameter Arguments

To pass data to an IN or INOUT parameter of an SPJ, specify an SQL value
expression that evaluates to a character, date-time, or numeric value.
The SQL value expression can evaluate to NULL provided that the
underlying Java parameter supports null values. For more information,
see <<null-input-and-output, Null Input and Output>>.

For an IN parameter argument, use one of these SQL value expressions in
that table below:

[[table-2]]
.Input Parameter Argument Types
[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]
|===
| Type of Argument         | Examples
| Literal                  |
`CALL adjustsalary( *202*, 5.5, ? ) ;` +
`CALL dailyorders( *DATE '2011-03-19'*, ? )` ; +
`CALL totalprice(23, *'nextday'* , ?param ) ;`
| SQL function (including CASE and CAST expressions) |
`CALL dailyorders( *CURRENT_DATE*, ? ) ;`
| Arithmetic expression |
`CALL adjustsalary( 202, *?percent \* 0.25*, :OUT newsalary ) ;`
| Concatenation operation |
`CALL totalprice( 23, *'next' \|\| 'day'*, ?param ) ;`
| Scalar subquery | 
`CALL totalprice ( ( SELECT qty_ordered FROM odetail WHERE ordernum = 100210 AND partnum = 5100 ) , 'nextday', ?param ) ;` 
| Dynamic parameter |
`CALL adjustsalary( *?*, ?, ?) ;` +
`CALL adjustsalary( *?param1*, ?param2, ?param3 ) ;`
|===

For more information about SQL value expressions, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual].

Because an INOUT parameter passes a single value to and accepts a single
value from an SPJ, you can specify only dynamic parameters for INOUT
parameter arguments in a CALL statement.

<<<
[[output-parameter-arguments]]
==== Output Parameter Arguments

Except for result sets, an SPJ returns values in OUT and INOUT
parameters. Each OUT or INOUT parameter accepts only one value from an
SPJ. Any attempt to return more than one value to an output parameter
results in a Java exception. See
<<returning-output-values-from-the-java-method, Returning Output Values From the Java Method>>.

OUT and INOUT parameter arguments must be dynamic parameters in a client
application (for example, `?`) or named or unnamed parameters in trafci
(for example, `?param` or `?`).

For information about how to call SPJs in different applications, see:

* <<calling-spjs-in-trafci, Calling SPJs in trafci>>
* <<calling-spjs-from-an-odbc-client-application, Calling SPJs From an ODBC Client Application>>
* <<calling-spjs-from-a-jdbc-client-application, Calling SPJs From a JDBC Client Application>>

[[result-sets]]
==== Result Sets

Result sets are an ordered set of open cursors that the SPJ method
returns to the calling application in `java.sql.ResultSet[]` parameter
arrays. The `java.sql.ResultSet[]` parameters do not correspond to SQL
parameters, so you must not include them in the parameter argument list
of a CALL statement.

The calling application can retrieve multiple rows of data from the
`java.sql.ResultSet[]` parameters. For information about how to process
result sets in different applications, see:

* <<returning-result-sets-in-trafci, Returning Result Sets in trafci>>
* <<returning-result-sets-in-an-odbc-client, Returning Result Sets in an ODBC Client>>
* <<returning-result-sets-in-a-jdbc-client, Returning Result Sets in a JDBC Client>>

<<<
[[calling-spjs-in-trafci]]
== Calling SPJs in trafci

In trafci, you can invoke an SPJ by issuing a CALL statement directly or
by preparing and executing a CALL statement.

Use named or unnamed parameters anywhere in the argument list of an SPJ
invoked in trafci. A named parameter is set by the SET PARAM command, and
an unnamed parameter is set by the USING clause of the EXECUTE
statement.

You must use a parameter for an OUT or INOUT parameter argument. trafci
displays all output parameter values and result sets after you issue the
CALL statement. The procedure call changes the value of a named
parameter that you use as an OUT or INOUT parameter.

For more information about named and unnamed parameters, see the
{docs-url}/command_interface/index.html[{project-name} Command Interface Guide].

[[using-named-parameters]]
=== Using Named Parameters

In an trafci session, invoke the SPJ named TOTALPRICE, which has two IN
parameters and one INOUT parameter.

This SPJ accepts the quantity, shipping speed, and price of an item,
calculates the total price, including tax and shipping charges, and
returns the total price. For more information, see the
<<totalprice-procedure, TOTALPRICE Procedure>>.

Set the input value for the INOUT parameter by entering a SET PARAM
command before calling the SPJ:

[source, sql]
----
SQL> SET PARAM ?p 10 ;

SQL> CALL trafodion.sales.totalprice( 23, 'standard', ?p ) ;
----

The CALL statement returns the total price of the item:

```
p
--------------------
253.97

--- SQL operation complete.
```

The value of the named parameter, ?p, changes from 10 to the returned
value, 253.97:

[source, sql]
----
SQL> SHOW PARAM

p 253.97
----

<<<
[[using-unnamed-parameters]]
=== Using Unnamed Parameters

In an trafci session, invoke the SPJ named TOTALPRICE by preparing and
executing a CALL statement. The INOUT parameter accepts a value that is
set by the USING clause of the EXECUTE statement and returns the total
price:

[source, sql]
----
SQL> PREPARE stmt1 FROM CALL trafodion.sales.totalprice( 50, 'nextday', ? ) ;

--- SQL command prepared.

SQL> EXECUTE stmt1 USING 2.25 ; 
----

The output of the prepared CALL statement is:

```
PRICE
--------------------
136.77

--- SQL operation complete.
```

In an trafci session, invoke the SPJ named TOTALPRICE again by preparing
and executing a CALL statement in which all three parameters accept
values that are set by the USING clause of the EXECUTE statement. The
INOUT parameter returns the total price:

[source, sql]
----
SQL> PREPARE stmt2 FROM CALL trafodion.sales.totalprice( ?, ?, ? ) ;

--- SQL command prepared.

SQL> EXECUTE stmt2 USING 3, 'economy', 16.99 ;
----

The output of the prepared CALL statement is:

[source, sql]
----
PRICE
--------------------

57.13

--- SQL operation complete.
----

<<<
[[returning-result-sets-in-trafci]]
=== Returning Result Sets in trafci

If a CALL statement returns result sets, trafci displays column headings
and data for each returned result set in the same format as SELECT
statements. For example, this CALL statement returns an output parameter
for the number of orders and two result sets in the trafci session:


[source, sql]
----
SQL> CALL trafodion.sales.ordersummary( '01-01-2011', ? ) ;

[[calling-spjs-from-an-odbc-client-application]]
== Calling SPJs From an ODBC Client Application

You can execute a CALL statement in an ODBC client application.
Microsoft ODBC requires that you put the CALL statement in an escape
clause:

[source, sql]
----
{ CALL procedure-name ( [ parameter ] [ , [ parameter ] ] ... ) }
----

For IN or INOUT parameters, use a literal or a parameter marker (?). You
cannot use an empty string as an IN or INOUT parameter in the argument
list. If you specify a literal for an INOUT parameter, the driver
discards the output value.

For OUT parameters, you can use only a parameter marker (`?`). You must
bind all parameter markers with the `SQLBindParameter` function before you
can execute the CALL statement.

In this example, a CALL statement is executed from an ODBC client
application:

[source, cplusplus]
----
/* Declare variables. */
SQLHSTMT hstmt ;
SQL_NUMERIC_STRUCT salary ;
SDWORD cbParam = SQL_NTS ;

/* Bind the parameter markers. */

<<<
[[calling-spjs-from-a-jdbc-client-application]]
== Calling SPJs From a JDBC Client Application

You can execute a CALL statement in a JDBC client application by using
the JDBC CallableStatement interface. The Trafodion JDBC Type 4 driver requires
that you put the CALL statement in an escape clause:

[source, sql]
----
{ CALL procedure-name ( [ parameter [ { , parameter } ... ] ] ) }
----

Set input values for IN and INOUT parameters by using the `set_type()`
methods of the `CallableStatement` interface.

Retrieve output values from OUT and INOUT parameters by using the
`get_type()` methods of the `CallableStatement` interface.

If the parameter mode is OUT or INOUT, then you must register the parameter
as an output parameter by using the `registerOutParameter()` method of the
`CallableStatement` interface before executing the CALL statement.

In this example, a CALL statement is executed from a JDBC client application:

[source, java]
----
CallableStatement stmt =
   con.prepareCall( "{ CALL trafodion.persnl.adjustsalary( ?, ?, ? ) }" ) ;

stmt.setBigDecimal( 1, 202 ) ; // x = 202
stmt.setDouble( 2, 5.5 ) ;     // y = 5.5
stmt.registerOutParameter( 3, java.sql.Types.NUMERIC ) ;
stmt.execute() ;

BigDecimal z = stmt.getBigDecimal( 3 ) ; // Retrieve the value of the OUT parameter

[[returning-result-sets-in-a-jdbc-client-application]]
=== Returning Result Sets in a JDBC Client Application

This example shows serial result set processing in a JDBC client
application where the result sets are processed in order and one at a
time after the CALL statement executes. The
`java.sql.Statement.getMoreResults()` method closes the current result set
and moves processing to the next available result set.

[source, java]
----
// Prepare a CALL statement
java.sql.CallableStatement s =
   myConnection.prepareCall( "{ CALL trafodion.sales.ordersummary( '01-01-2011', ? ) }" ) ;

// Register an output parameter
s.registerOutParameter( 1, java.sql.Types.BIGINT ) ;

// Execute the CALL
boolean rsAvailable = s.execute() ;

// Process all returned result sets. The outer while loop continues
// until there are no more result sets.
while ( rsAvailable )
{
   // The inner while loop processes each row of the current result set
   java.sql.ResultSet rs = s.getResultSet() ;
   while ( rs.next() )
   {
      // Process the row
   }

   rsAvailable = s.getMoreResults() ;
}
----

This example shows how a JDBC client application can have more than one
stored procedure result set open at a given time. The
`java.sql.Statement.getMoreResults(int)` method
uses its input argument to decide whether currently open result sets
should remain open or be closed before the next result set is made
available.

[source, java]
----
// Prepare a CALL statement
java.sql.CallableStatement s =
   myConnection.prepareCall ( "{ CALL trafodion.sales.ordersummary( '01-01-2011', ? ) }" ) ;

// Register an output parameter
s.registerOutParameter( 1, java.sql.Types.BIGINT ) ;

// Execute the CALL
s.execute() ;

// Open the FIRST result set
java.sql.ResultSet firstRS = s.getResultSet() ;

// Open the SECOND result set but do not close the FIRST
s.getMoreResults( java.sql.Statement.KEEP_CURRENT_RESULT ) ;
java.sql.ResultSet secondRS = s.getResultSet() ;

// The outer loop processes each row of the FIRST result set while

[[calling-an-spj-in-a-trigger]]
== Calling an SPJ in a Trigger

A trigger is a mechanism in the database that enables the database
engine to perform certain actions when a specified event occurs. SPJs
are useful as triggered actions because they can help you encapsulate
and enforce rules in the database. For more information about the
benefits of using SPJs, see <<benefits-of-spjs, Benefits of SPJs>>

{project-name} SQL supports a CALL statement in a trigger provided that the
SPJ in the CALL statement does not have any OUT or INOUT parameters or
return any result sets. For more information, see
<<returning-output-values-from-the-java-method, Returning Output Values From the Java Method>>,
<<output-parameter-arguments, Output Parameter Arguments>>, or
<<returning-stored-procedure-result-sets, Returning Stored Procedure Result Sets>>.

This example creates a trigger that executes an SPJ named LOWERPRICE
when the QTY_ON_HAND column of the PARTLOC table is updated and exceeds
500 parts:

[source, sql]
----
CREATE TRIGGER trafodion.sales.setsalesprice AFTER UPDATE OF qty_on_hand
ON trafodion.invent.partloc
FOR EACH STATEMENT REFERENCING NEW as newqty
    WHEN ( SUM( newqty.qty_on_hand ) > 500 )
