= About This Document
This guide describes how to develop, deploy, and manage Stored Procedures in Java (SPJs) on {project-name}.

== Intended Audience
This manual is intended for application programmers who are writing and compiling Java code for stored procedures
and for database administrators who are deploying and managing Stored Procedures in Java (SPJs) on {project-name}.
The reader should know:

* The Java programming language.
* JDBC and the {project-name} JDBC Type-4 Driver.
* Structured Query Language (SQL) and database terms and concepts.

Although not required, it helps to be familiar with the part of the ANSI SQL/Foundation standard called
SQL/JRT (Java Routines and Types) on which this implementation of stored procedures is based.

== Document Organization

This document is organized as follows:

[cols="30%,70%", options="header"]

| Chapter                                              | Description
| *<<introduction, Introduction>>*                     | Defines what an SPJ is, describes the benefits of using SPJs on the database,
and lists steps for developing and deploying SPJs on {project-name}.
| *<<get-started, Get Started>>*                       | Describes the software requirements for using SPJs on {project-name}.
| *<<develop-spj-methods, Develop SPJ Methods>>*       | Provides guidelines for writing and compiling a Java method to be used as the
body of a stored procedure.
| *<<deploy-spj-jar-files, Deploy SPJ JAR Files>>*     | Explains how to deploy SPJ JAR files on {project-name}.
| *<<create-spjs, Create SPJs>>*                       | Explains how to create, drop, and alter an SPJ on {project-name}.            
| *<<grant-privileges, Grant Privileges>>*             | Explains how to grant and revoke privileges for executing SPJs on the
{project-name} database.
| *<<execute-spjs, Execute SPJs>>*                     | Explains how to execute an SPJ on {project-name} by using the CALL statement.
| *<<performance-and-troubleshooting, Performance and Troubleshooting>>* | 
Describes how to improve and monitor the performance of SPJs and provides guidelines for troubleshooting common problems.
| *<<sample-spjs, Appendix A: Sample SPJs>>*           | Provides examples of SPJ methods that demonstrate business logic on {project-name}.
| *<<sample-database, Appendix B: Sample Database>>*   | Describes the sample database on which the Sample SPJs operate.

== New and Changed Information
This is a new manual.

== Notation Conventions
This list summarizes the notation conventions for syntax presentation in this manual.

* UPPERCASE LETTERS
+
Uppercase letters indicate keywords and reserved words. Type these items exactly as shown. Items not enclosed in brackets are required. 
+
```
SELECT
```

* lowercase letters
+
Lowercase letters, regardless of font, indicate variable items that you supply. Items not enclosed in brackets are required.
+
```
file-name
```

* &#91; &#93; Brackets 
+
Brackets enclose optional syntax items.
+
```
DATETIME [start-field TO] end-field
```
+
A group of items enclosed in brackets is a list from which you can choose one item or none.
+
The items in the list can be arranged either vertically, with aligned brackets on each side of the list, or horizontally, enclosed in a pair of brackets and separated by vertical lines.
+
For example: 
+
```
DROP SCHEMA schema [CASCADE]
DROP SCHEMA schema [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

* { } Braces 
+
Braces enclose required syntax items.
+
```
FROM { grantee [, grantee ] ... }
```
+ 
A group of items enclosed in braces is a list from which you are required to choose one item.
+
The items in the list can be arranged either vertically, with aligned braces on each side of the list, or horizontally, enclosed in a pair of braces and separated by vertical lines.
+
For example:
+
```
INTERVAL { start-field TO end-field }
{ single-field } 
INTERVAL { start-field TO end-field | single-field }
``` 
* | Vertical Line 
+
A vertical line separates alternatives in a horizontal list that is enclosed in brackets or braces.
```
{expression | NULL} 
```

* &#8230; Ellipsis
+
An ellipsis immediately following a pair of brackets or braces indicates that you can repeat the enclosed sequence of syntax items any number of times.
+
```
ATTRIBUTE[S] attribute [, attribute] ...
{, sql-expression } ...
```
+ 
An ellipsis immediately following a single syntax item indicates that you can repeat that syntax item any number of times.
+
For example:
+
```
expression-n ...
```

<<<
* Punctuation
+
Parentheses, commas, semicolons, and other symbols not previously described must be typed as shown.
+
```
DAY (datetime-expression)
@script-file 
```
+
Quotation marks around a symbol such as a bracket or brace indicate the symbol is a required character that you must type as shown.
+
For example:
+
```
"{" module-name [, module-name] ... "}"
```

* Item Spacing
+
Spaces shown between items are required unless one of the items is a punctuation symbol such as a parenthesis or a comma.
+
```
DAY (datetime-expression) DAY(datetime-expression)
```
+
If there is no space between two items, spaces are not permitted. In this example, no spaces are permitted between the period and any other items:
+
```
myfile.sh
```

* Line Spacing
+
If the syntax of a command is too long to fit on a single line, each continuation line is indented three spaces and is separated from the preceding line by a blank line.
+
This spacing distinguishes items in a continuation line from items in a vertical list of selections. 
+
```
match-value [NOT] LIKE _pattern
   [ESCAPE esc-char-expression] 
```
