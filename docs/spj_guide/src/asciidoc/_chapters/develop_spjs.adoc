= Develop SPJ Methods

Before creating, or registering, an SPJ in the database, you must write
and compile the Java method to be used as the body of the SPJ. The
manual refers to those Java methods as _SPJ methods_.

This chapter requires a familiarity with writing and compiling Java programs.

[[guidelines-for-writing-spj-methods]]
== Guidelines for Writing SPJ Methods

Follow the guidelines for these topics when you write SPJ methods to be
used as SPJs in the database:

[[signature-of-the-java-method]]
=== Signature of the Java Method

A Java method that you use as an SPJ must have this general signature:

[source, java]
----
public static void myMethodName ( java-parameter-list )
----

[[public-access-and-static-modifiers]]
==== Public Access and Static Modifiers

The Java method must be defined as `public` and `static`. If a method is
`private` or `protected`, then {project-name} is unable to find the Java
method when you try to register the SPJ and returns an error. The Java
method must be defined as `static` so that the method can be invoked
without having to instantiate its class.

[[void-return-type]]
==== Void Return Type

The return type of the Java method must be `void`. The method must not
return a value directly to the caller.

[[java-parameters]]
==== Java Parameters

Except for result sets, which are described in
<<returning-stored-procedure-result-sets, Returning Stored Procedure Result Sets>>,
the parameter types in the Java signature must correspond to the SQL
parameters of the stored procedure that you are planning to create. For
type mappings, see the table below.

<<<
[[table-1]]
.Mapping of Java Data Types to SQL Data Types

[cols="60%,40%",options="header"]
|===
| SQL Data Type | Maps to Java Data Type&#8230;
| CHAR[ACTER] +
CHAR[ACTER] VARYING +
VARCHAR +
PIC[TURE] X^1^ +
NCHAR +
NCHAR VARYING +
NATIONAL CHAR[ACTER] +
NATIONAL CHAR[ACTER] VARYING | java.lang.string
| DATE | java.sql.date
| TIME | java.sql.time
| TIMESTAMP | java.sql.timestamp
| DEC[IMAL]^2^ +
PIC[TURE] S9^3^ +
NUMERIC (including numeric with a precision greater than eighteen)^2^ | java.math.bigdecimal
| SMALLINT^2^ | short
| INT[EGER]^2^ | int or java.lang.integer^4^
| LARGEINT^2^ | long or java.lang.long^4^
| FLOAT | double or java.lang.double^4^
| REAL | float or java.lang.float^4^
| DOUBLE PRECISION | double or java.lang.double^4^
|===

1. {project-name} stores PIC X as a CHAR data type.
2. Numeric data types of SQL parameters must be signed, which is the default in {project-name}.
3. {project-name} stores PIC S9 as a DECIMAL or NUMERIC data type.
4. By default, the SQL data type maps to a Java primitive type. The SQL data type maps to a Java wrapper class
only if you specify the wrapper class in the Java signature of the external name clause.

Output parameters in the Java signature must be arrays (for example,
`int[]` or `String[]`) that accept only one value in the first element of
the array at index 0. For more information, see
<<returning-output-values-from-the-java-method, Returning Output Values From the Java Method>>.

<<<
[[returning-output-values-from-the-java-method]]
=== Returning Output Values From the Java Method

The Java method can return data to the calling application in the form
of output parameters or result sets.

_Output parameters_ in the Java signature are parameter arrays that
accept only one value in the first element of the array at index 0. The
array objects have a fixed size of one element.

IMPORTANT: You cannot return more than one value to an output parameter of an SPJ.
Any attempt to return more than one value to an output parameter results in a Java exception,
`ArrayIndexOutOfBounds`.

_Result sets_ in the Java signature are one-element `java.sql.ResultSet[]`
arrays that contain ResultSet objects that have multiple rows of data.
For more information about result sets, see
<<returning-stored-procedure-result-sets, Returning Stored Procedure Result Sets>>

This subsection covers these topics related to output parameters:

* <<using-arrays-for-output-parameters, Using Arrays for Output Parameters>>
* <<type-mapping-of-output-parameters, Type Mapping of Output Parameters>>

[[using-arrays-for-output-parameters]]
==== Using Arrays for Output Parameters

You must use arrays for the output parameters of a Java method because
of how Java handles the arguments of a method. Java supports arguments
that are passed by value to a method and does not support arguments that
are passed by reference. As a result, Java primitive types can be passed
only to a method, not out of a method. Because a Java array is an
object, its reference is passed by value to a method, and changes to the
array are visible to the caller of the method. Therefore, arrays must be
used for output parameters in a Java method.

IMPORTANT: An output parameter accepts only one value in the first element
of the array at index 0. Any attempt to return more than one value to an
output parameter results in a Java exception, `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds`.

For each output parameter, specify the Java type followed by empty
square brackets (`[]`) to indicate that the type is an array. For example,
specify an int type as `int[]` for an output parameter in the Java
signature.

To return multiple values from a Java method, use an output parameter
for each returned value. For example, the `supplierInfo()` method returns
a supplier's name, address, city, state, and post code, each as a single
string in an output parameter:

<<<
The `supplyQuantities()` method returns an average quantity, a minimum
quantity, and a maximum quantity to separate output parameters of the
integer type:

[source, java]
----
public static void supplyQuantities( int[] avgQty
                                   , int[] minQty
                                   , int[] maxQty
                                   ) throws SQLException
{

...

}

----

For more information about the SPJ examples, see
<<sample-spjs, Appendix A: Sample SPJs>>.

[[type-mapping-of-output-parameters]]
==== Type Mapping of Output Parameters

When writing an SPJ method, consider how the output of the SPJ is
used in the calling application. For output parameters, the Java data
type of the SPJ method must map to an SQL data type. See
<<table-1, Table 1>>.

The SQL data type must then map to a compatible data type in the calling
application. For the client application programming interfaces (APIs) that
support SPJs and for cross-references to the appropriate manuals for type
mappings between {project-name} SQL and each API, see
<<execute-spjs, Execute SPJs>> below.

[[returning-stored-procedure-result-sets]]
=== Returning Stored Procedure Result Sets

{project-name} supports SPJs that return stored procedure
result sets. A stored procedure result set is a cursor that is left open
after the SPJ method executes (that is, after the CALL statement
executes successfully). After the CALL statement executes successfully,
the calling application can issue requests to open and then retrieve
multiple rows of data from the returned result sets.

An SPJ method returns an ordered collection of result sets to the
calling application by executing SELECT statements and placing each
returned ResultSet object into a one-element Java array of type
`java.sql.ResultSet[]`. The `java.sql.ResultSet[]` array is part of the Java
method's signature and is recognized by the database engine as a
container for a single stored procedure result set.

Place the `java.sql.ResultSet[]` parameters after the other Java
parameters, if any, in the Java signature. If you do not place the
`java.sql.ResultSet[]` parameters after the other
parameters in the signature, the database engine prevents you from
creating an SPJ using that Java method. This example shows the
declaration of an SPJ method, `orderSummary()`, which returns a maximum of
two result sets:

[source, java]
----
public static void orderSummary( java.lang.String onOrAfter
                               , long[] numOrders
                               , java.sql.ResultSet[] orders
                               , java.sql.ResultSet[] detail
                               )
----

This code fragment shows how the `orderSummary()` method returns one of
its result sets by executing a SELECT statement and assigning the
`java.sql.ResultSet` object to a `java.sql.ResultSet[]` output array:

[source,java]
----
// Open a result set for order num, order info rows
java.lang.String s =
     "SELECT amounts.*, orders.order_date, emps.last_name "
   + "FROM ( SELECT o.ordernum, COUNT( d.partnum ) AS num_parts, "
   + "       SUM( d.unit_price * d.qty_ordered ) AS amount "
   + "       FROM trafodion.sales.orders o, trafodion.sales.odetail d "
   + "       WHERE o.ordernum = d.ordernum "
   + "         AND o.order_date >= CAST(? AS DATE) "
   + "       GROUP BY o.ordernum ) amounts, "
   + "   trafodion.sales.orders orders, trafodion.persnl.employee emps "
   + "WHERE amounts.ordernum = orders.ordernum "
   + "  AND orders.salesrep = emps.empnum "
   + "ORDER BY orders.ordernum "
   ;

java.sql.PreparedStatement ps2 = conn.prepareStatement(s) ;
ps2.setString( 1, onOrAfter ) ;

// Assign the returned result set object to the first element of a
// java.sql.ResultSet[] output array
orders[0] = ps2.executeQuery() ;
----

For the entire example, see 
<<ordersummary-procedure, ORDERSUMMARY Procedure>>.

IMPORTANT: In an SPJ method that returns result sets, do not explicitly close
the default connection or the statement object. The database engine closes the
connection used to return result sets after it finishes processing the result
sets. If you close the connection on which the result sets are being returned,
those result sets will be lost, and the calling application will not be able
to process them.

An SPJ method can return result sets that contain any data types, except
large object (LOB) data. An SPJ method can return a holdable or
updatable cursor as a result set. However, {project-name} SQL does not expose
those attributes in the calling application. An SPJ method can return a
ResultSet object that is a stored procedure result set acquired from a
nested CALL statement executed by the SPJ method. However, you are
discouraged from nesting CALL statements in SPJ methods. For more
information, see <<nested-java-method-invocations, Nested Java Method Invocations>>.

<<<
If an SPJ method returns multiple ResultSet objects, the database engine
sorts the collection of valid result sets in chronological order
according to when the underlying SQL statements were executed. If the
number of result sets exceeds the declared maximum for the SPJ, only the
first set of result sets up to the maximum number are returned. The
database engine discards the other result sets and returns a warning to
the calling application.

When an SPJ method returns a ResultSet object through a
`java.sql.ResultSet[]` parameter, {project-name} SQL exposes the underlying rows
of data as an SQL cursor in the calling application.

If a returned result set is a scrollable cursor, all underlying rows are
included in the result set and are available to the calling application.
If a returned result set is not scrollable, only those rows not
processed by the SPJ method are included in the result set and are
available to the calling application. If an SPJ method returns multiple
occurrences of the same ResultSet object, the database engine ignores
all but one occurrence and makes the underlying rows available to the
calling application as a single result set.

For information about processing result sets in different calling
applications, see:

* <<returning-result-sets-in-trafci, Returning Result Sets in trafci>>
* <<returning-result-sets-in-an-odbc-client-application, Returning Result Sets in an ODBC Client Application>>
* <<returning-result-sets-in-a-jdbc-client-application, Returning Result Sets in a JDBC Client Application>>

[[using-the-main-method]]
=== Using the main() Method

You can use the `main()` method of a Java class file as an SPJ method. The
`main()` method is different from other Java methods because it accepts
input values in an array of `java.lang.String` objects and does not return
any values in its array parameter.

For example, you can register this main() method as an SPJ:

[source,java]
----
public static void main (java.lang.String [] args)
{

...

}
----

When you register a `main()` method as an SPJ, you can specify zero or
more SQL parameters, even though the underlying `main()` method has only
one array parameter. All the SQL parameters of the SPJ must have the
character string data type, CHAR or VARCHAR, and be declared with the IN
mode.

If you specify the optional Java signature, the signature must be
(`java.lang.String []`). For more information about registering an SPJ,
see <<create-spjs, Create SPJs>>.

[[null-input-and-output]]
=== Null Input and Output

You can pass a `null` value as input to or output from an SPJ method,
provided that the Java data type of the parameter supports nulls. Java
primitive data types do not support nulls. However, Java wrapper classes
that correspond to primitive data types do support nulls. If a null is
input or output for a parameter that does not support nulls, the
database engine raises an error condition.

To anticipate null input or output for your SPJ, use Java wrapper
classes instead of primitive data types in the method signature.

For example, this Java method uses a Java primitive data type in its
signature where no null values are expected:

[source, java]
----
public static void employeeJob( int empNum, Integer[] jobCode )
----

This Java method also uses a Java wrapper class in its signature to
anticipate a possible returned null value:

[source, java]
----
public static void employeeJob( int empNum, Integer[] jobCode )
----

[[static-java-variables]]
=== Static Java Variables

To ensure that your SPJ method is portable, you should avoid using
static variables in the method. The database engine does not ensure the
scope and persistence of static Java variables.

[[nested-java-method-invocations]]
=== Nested Java Method Invocations

An SPJ that invokes another SPJ by issuing a CALL statement causes
additional system resources to be used. If you want an SPJ method to
call another SPJ method, consider invoking the other Java method
directly through Java instead of using a CALL statement. The other Java
method should be packaged in the same JAR file as the SPJ method. For
more information, see
<<compiling-and-packaging-java-classes, Compiling and Packaging Java Classes>>.

<<<
[[accessing-a-trafodion-database]]
== Accessing {project-name}

SPJ methods that access {project-name} must be from a Java class
that uses JDBC method calls. Follow these guidelines when writing an SPJ
method that accesses {project-name}:

[[use-of-java.sql.connection-objects]]
=== Use of java.sql.Connection Objects

{project-name} supports a default connection in an SPJ
execution environment, which has a data source URL of
`"jdbc:default:connection"`. For example:

[source, java]
----
Connection conn =
   DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:default:connection" ) ;
----

`java.sql.Connection` objects that use the `"jdbc:default:connection"` URL
are portable to {project-name} from other database management
systems (DBMSs).

[[closing-default-connections]]
==== Closing Default Connections

{project-name} controls default connections in the SPJ
environment and closes default connections when they are no longer
needed. Therefore, you do not need to use the `close()` method in an SPJ
method to explicitly close a default connection when the connection is
no longer needed.

IMPORTANT: If an SPJ method returns result sets, you should not explicitly
close the default connection. The database engine closes the connection used
to return result sets after it finishes processing the result sets. If an SPJ
method closes the connection on which the result sets are being returned, those
result sets will be lost, and the calling application will not be able to
process them. The JVM does not return an error or warning when the
connection is closed.

A default connection that is acquired when an SPJ method executes does
not necessarily remain open for future invocations of the SPJ method.
Therefore, do not store default connections in static variables for
future use.

[[default-connection-url]]
==== Default Connection URL

The default connection URL, `"jdbc:default:connection"`, is invalid when
the Java method is invoked outside the DBMS, such as when you execute
the Java method in a client application. To write an SPJ method that
operates in a DBMS, in a client application, or both, without having to
change and recompile the code, use the `sqlj.defaultconnection` system
property:

[source, java]
----
String s = System.property( "sqlj.defaultconnection" ) ;
if ( s == null )
{
   s = other-url ;
}

Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection( s ) ;
----

The value of `sqlj.defaultconnection` is `"jdbc:default:connection"` in a
DBMS and `null` outside a DBMS.

[[connection-pooling]]
==== Connection Pooling

Connection pooling, where a cache of database connections is assigned to
a client session and reused, is enabled by default in the SPJ
environment. The SPJ environment sets the initial connection pool size
to `1`, but it does not limit the number of connections an SPJ method can
make.

The SPJ environment also sets the minimum connection pool size to 1 so that
there is always at least one connection available in the pool. The
default settings in the SPJ environment are:

* `maxPoolSize=0`
* `minPoolSize=1`
* `initialPoolSize=1`

To change these settings, use the properties parameter of the
`DriverManager.getConnection()` method as shown below:

[source, java]
----
java.util.Properties props = new Properties() ;

props.setProperty( "maxPoolSize", "10" ) ;
props.setProperty( "minPoolSize", "5" ) ;
props.setProperty( "initialPoolSize", "5" ) ;

Connection conn =
   DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:default:connection", props ) ;
----

<<<
[[using-jdbc-method-calls]]
=== Using JDBC Method Calls

{project-name} uses a JDBC Type-4 driver internally to execute
the SQL statements inside an SPJ method. To enable an SPJ to perform SQL
operations on a {project-name} database, use JDBC method calls in the SPJ
method. The JDBC method calls must be supported by the JDBC Type-4
driver on {project-name}.

For example, if you want the SPJ method to operate on a {project-name} database,
use the JDBC API that is supported by {project-name}.

NOTE: You do not have to explicitly load the JDBC driver before
establishing a connection to {project-name}. The database engine
automatically loads the JDBC driver when the SPJ is called.

Here is an example of an SPJ method, `adjustSalary()`, that uses JDBC
method calls to adjust an employee's salary in the EMPLOYEE table:

[source, java]
----
public class Payroll
{
   public static void adjustSalary( BigDecimal empNum
                                  , double percent
                                  , BigDecimal[] newSalary
                                  ) throws SQLException
   {
      Connection conn =
         DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:default:connection" ) ;

      PreparedStatement setSalary =
         conn.prepareStatement( "UPDATE trafodion.persnl.employee "
                              + "SET salary = salary * (1 + (? / 100)) "
                              + "WHERE empnum = ?"
                              ) ;
 
      PreparedStatement getSalary =
         conn.prepareStatement( "SELECT salary "
                              + "FROM trafodion.persnl.employee "
                              + "WHERE empnum = ?"
                              ) ;

      setSalary.setDouble( 1, percent ) ;
      setSalary.setBigDecimal( 2, empNum ) ;
      setSalary.executeUpdate() ;

      getSalary.setBigDecimal( 1, empNum ) ;
      ResultSet rs = getSalary.executeQuery() ;
      rs.next() ;

      newSalary[0] = rs.getBigDecimal( 1 ) ;

      rs.close();
      conn.close();
   }
}
----

For other examples of SPJ methods, see <<sample-spjs, Appendix A: Sample SPJs>>.

[[referring-to-database-objects-in-an-spj-method]]
=== Referring to Database Objects in an SPJ Method

In an SPJ method, you can refer to SQL database objects by specifying
three-part ANSI names that include the catalog, schema, and object name.
For more information about database object names, see the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.hmtl[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual].

The database engine propagates the names of the catalog and schema where
the SPJ is registered to the SPJ environment. By default, database
connections created in the SPJ method are associated with that catalog
and schema, meaning that unqualified database objects with one-part or
two-part names in the SPJ method are qualified with the same catalog
and/or schema name as the SPJ. For example, this SPJ method, which is
registered as an SPJ in the TRAFODION.SALES schema, refers to the unqualified
database object, ORDERS:

[source, java]
----
public static void numDailyOrders( Date date
                                 , int[] numOrders
				 ) throws SQLException
{
   Connection conn =
      DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:default:connection" ) ;

   PreparedStatement getNumOrders =
      conn.prepareStatement( "SELECT COUNT( order_date ) "
                           + "FROM orders "
			   + "WHERE order_date = ?"
			   ) ;

   getNumOrders.setDate( 1, date ) ;

   ResultSet rs = getNumOrders.executeQuery() ;
   rs.next() ;

   numOrders[0] = rs.getInt( 1 ) ;

   rs.close() ;
   conn.close() ;

}
----

In the SPJ environment, the ORDERS table is qualified by default with
the same catalog and schema as the SPJ, TRAFODION.SALES.

The default behavior takes effect only when `getConnection()` does not
contain catalog and schema properties. Catalog and schema property
values in `getConnection()` have higher precedence over the default
behavior. To override the default schema name and associate a database
connection with a different schema, specify the schema property during
connection creation. For example, `getConnection()` in this SPJ method
specifies the schema, SALES2, which overrides the default schema, SALES:

[source, java]
----
public static void numDailyOrders( Date date
                                 , int[] numOrders
				 ) throws SQLException
{
   Properties prop = new Properties() ;
   prop.setProperty( "schema", "SALES2" ) ;

   Connection conn =
      DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:default:connection", prop) ;

   PreparedStatement getNumOrders =
      conn.prepareStatement( "SELECT COUNT( order_date ) "
                           + "FROM orders "
			   + "WHERE order_date = ?"
			   ) ;

   getNumOrders.setDate( 1, date ) ;

   ResultSet rs = getNumOrders.executeQuery() ;
   rs.next() ;

   numOrders[0] = rs.getInt( 1 ) ;

   rs.close() ;
   conn.close() ;

}
----

Be aware that overriding the default values by using getConnection()
requires you to hard-code the catalog or schema name and might make SPJ
methods less portable across systems.

[[using-the-session_user-or-current_user-function-in-an-spj-method]]
=== Using the SESSION_USER or CURRENT_USER Function in an SPJ Method

SESSION_USER is an SQL function that returns the name of the
authenticated database user who started the session and invoked the
function, and CURRENT_USER (or USER) is an SQL function that returns the
name of the database user who is authorized to invoke the function. If
you plan to use the SESSION_USER or CURRENT_USER (or USER) function in
an SPJ method, you should be aware of differences in their behavior
depending on how external security is defined for the stored procedure.

Suppose that you write this Java method, which uses the CURRENT_USER
function to return the name of the database user who is authorized to
invoke the function:

[source, java]
----
public static void getUser( ResultSet [] rs ) throws SQLException
{
   Connection conn =
      DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:default:connection" ) ;

   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement() ;

   rs[0] =
      stmt.executeQuery( "SELECT CURRENT_USER FROM (VALUES(1)) X(A) ; " ) ;
}
----

If this method is used in a stored procedure with external security
defined as _invoker_, the CURRENT_USER function returns the name of
the database user who is authorized to invoke the function, which
happens to be the authenticated database user who started the session
and called the stored procedure.

For example, suppose that DB USERADMINUSER creates a stored procedure
named GETINVOKER using the `getUser()` method and sets the external
security to invoker. If a database user named GTAPPER, who has the
EXECUTE privilege on the stored procedure, calls GETINVOKER, the procedure
returns his name:

```
Welcome to Apache Trafodion Command Interface
Copyright (c) 2015 Apache Software Foundation

User Name:GTAPPER Password:

Connected to Data Source: TDM_Default_DataSource

SQL> CALL trafodion.persnl.getinvoker() ;

(EXPR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTAPPER

--- 1 row(s) selected.

--- SQL operation complete.
```

If the method is used in a stored procedure with external security
defined as _definer_, the CURRENT_USER function returns the name of
the database user who is authorized to invoke the function, which
happens to be the user who created the stored procedure (that is, the
definer of the stored procedure). When a stored procedure's external
security is set to definer, any user who has the execute privilege on
the stored procedure can call the procedure using the privileges of the
user who created the stored procedure.

<<<
For example, suppose that DB USERADMINUSER creates a stored procedure
named GETDEFINER using the `getUser(`) method and sets the external
security to definer. If the database user named GTAPPER, who has the
EXECUTE privilege on the stored procedure, calls GETDEFINER, the procedure
returns the name of the stored procedures's creator, DB USERADMINUSER,
whose privileges GTAPPER is using to call the procedure:

```
SQL> SHOW USER

USER GTAPPER (NONE)

SQL> CALL trafodion.persnl.getdefiner() ;

(EXPR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DB USERADMINUSER

--- 1 row(s) selected.

--- SQL operation complete.
```

Suppose that you write this Java method, which uses the SESSION_USER
function to return the name of the authenticated database user who
started the session and invoked the function:

[source, java]
----
public static void getSessionUser( ResultSet [] rs ) throws SQLException
{
   Connection conn =
      DriverManager.getConnection( "jdbc:default:connection" ) ;

   Statement stmt = conn.createStatement() ;

   rs[0] = stmt.executeQuery( "SELECT SESSION_USER FROM (VALUES(1) ) X(A) ; " ) ;
}
----

The SESSION_USER function returns the name of the authenticated database
user who started the session and invoked the function, regardless of the
external security setting of the stored procedure.

<<<
For example, suppose that DB USERADMINUSER creates a stored procedure named
GETSESSIONUSER using the `getSessionUser()` method and sets the external
security to definer. If the database user named GTAPPER, who has the EXECUTE
privilege on the stored procedure, calls GETSESSIONUSER, the procedure
returns his name because he is the authenticated user who started the
session and invoked the function:

```
SQL> SHOW USER

USER GTAPPER (NONE)

SQL> CALL trafodion.persnl.getsessionuser() ;

(EXPR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTAPPER

--- 1 row(s) selected.

--- SQL operation complete.

[[exception-handling]]
=== Exception Handling

For SPJ methods that access {project-name}, no special code is
necessary for handling exceptions. If an SQL operation fails inside an
SPJ, the error message associated with the failure is returned to the
application that issues the CALL statement.

<<<
[[handling-java-exceptions]]
== Handling Java Exceptions

If an SPJ method returns an uncaught Java exception or an uncaught chain
of `java.sql.SQLException` objects, the database engine converts each Java
exception object into an SQL error condition, and the CALL statement
fails. Each SQL error condition contains the message text associated
with one Java exception object.

If an SPJ method catches and handles exceptions itself, those exceptions
do not affect SQL processing.

[[user-defined-exceptions]]
=== User-Defined Exceptions

The SQLSTATE values 38001 to 38999 are reserved for you to define your
own error conditions that SPJ methods can return. By coding your SPJ
method to throw a `java.sql.SQLException` object, you cause the CALL
statement to fail with a specific user-defined SQLSTATE value and your
own error message text.

If you define the SQLSTATE to be outside the range of 38001 to 38999,
the database engine raises SQLSTATE 39001, external routine invocation
exception.

This example uses the throw statement in the SPJ method named
`numMonthlyOrders()` to raise a user-defined error condition when an
invalid argument value is entered for the month:

[source, java]
----
public static void numMonthlyOrders( int month
                                   , int[] numOrders
				   ) throws java.sql.SQLException
{
   if ( month < 1 || month > 12 )
   {
      throw new
         java.sql.SQLException ( "Invalid value for month. "
                               + "Retry the CALL statement using a number "
                               + "from 1 to 12 to represent the month."
			       , "38001"
			       ) ;
   }

   ....
}
----

For more information about the numMonthlyOrders() method, see the
<<monthlyorders-procedure, MONTHLYORDERS Procedure>>.

For information about specific SQL errors, see the
{docs-url}/messages_guide/index.html[{project-name} Messages Manual], which lists
the SQLCODE, SQLSTATE, message text, and cause-effect-recovery information for all SQL errors.

[[compiling-and-packaging-java-classes]]
== Compiling and Packaging Java Classes

On {project-name}, the class files of SPJ methods must be
packaged in Java archive (JAR) files. After writing an SPJ method,
compile the Java source file of the SPJ method into Java bytecode and
package the Java bytecode in a JAR file. A Java method that you register
as an SPJ might need to access, either directly or indirectly, other
Java classes to operate properly. Those Java classes might include other
application classes. To enable an SPJ method to refer to other
application classes, put the application classes in the same JAR file as
the SPJ class. All classes stored in the same JAR file as the SPJ class
are accessible by default to the SPJ method.

.After writing the SPJ method

1.  Compile the Java source file into Java bytecode by using the Java
programming language compiler, `javac`:
+
```
javac Payroll.java
```

2.  Put the SPJ class file and all associated class files into a Java
archive (JAR) file:
+
```
jar cvf Payroll.jar Payroll.class
```
+
A manifest file is not needed for the JAR file.
