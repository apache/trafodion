[[deploy-spj-jar-files]]
= Deploy SPJ JAR Files

After developing and packaging the SPJ code into JAR files, you must
move the JAR files from the client workstation to {project-name}.

You can upload a SPJ JAR file and create a library by using
the CREATE LIBRARY command in the Trafodion Command Interface (trafci).

Libraries provide greater security for JAR files because libraries are
database objects whose access is controlled using standard SQL security.

Deploying a JAR file to a {project-name} instance requires creating a library,
and users must have the required privileges for creating libraries in order
to deploy JAR files.

The examples in this chapter are based on the sample database
documented in <<b-sample-database, Appendix B: Sample Database>>.

<<<
[[create-a-library]]
== Create a Library

Refer to the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual]
for full documentation of the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#create_library_statement[CREATE LIBRARY]
statement including considerations and required privileges.

NOTE: You must copy the jar file to the same directory on all the nodes in the cluster before running the CREATE LIBRARY statement.
Otherwise, you will see an error message indicating that the jar file is not found.

*Example*

This example uses the sample <<procedures-in-the-sales-schema, Sales Class>> documented in
<<a-sample-spjs, Appendix A: Sample SPJs>>.

Your task is to add the Sales class jar file as a library object in the `SALES` schema.
Do the following:

1. Compile the `Sales.java` source file.
+
*Example*
+
```
$ # Set up the environmental variables.
$ cd $HOME/trafodion-incubator
$ source env.sh
$ # Prepare the class jar file
$ cd $HOME/trafodion-spjs
$ ls
Inventory.java  Payroll.java  Sales.java
$ # Compile source
$ javac Sales.java
$ ls Sales.*
Sales.class  Sales.java
$ # Package jar file
$ jar cvf Sales.jar Sales.class
$ ls Sales.*
Sales.class  Sales.jar  Sales.java
$
```

2. Multi-node cluster only: Create the target directory, if necessary.
+
*Example*
+
```
$ pdsh $MY_NODES -x $HOSTNAME mkdir $HOME/trafodion-spjs
```
+
<<<
3. Multi-node cluster only: Copy the jar file to all nodes in the cluster.
+
*Example*
+
```
$ pdcp $MY_NODES Sales.jar $PWD/.
```

4. Create the library object using trafci.
+
```
$ pwd
/home/trafodion/trafodion-jars
$ trafci

[[alter-a-library]]
== Alter a Library

When you alter a library, you can change the underlying JAR file of the library.

Refer to the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual]
for full documentation of the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#alter_library_statement[ALTER LIBRARY]
statement including considerations and required privileges.

*Example*

Your task is to modify the Sales class jar file as a library object in the `SALES` schema
with a new jar file (`Sales2.jar`).

Do the following:

1. Multi-node cluster only: Copy the jar file to all nodes in the cluster.
+
*Example*
+
```
$ pdcp $MY_NODES Sales2.jar $PWD/.
```

2. Create the library object using trafci.
+
```
$ pwd
/home/trafodion/trafodion-jars
$ trafci

[[drop-a-library]]
== Drop a Library

Dropping a library removes the library from the schema in the database
and removes the library's underlying JAR file from {project-name}.

Refer to the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual]
for full documentation of the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#drop_library_statement[DROP LIBRARY]
statement including considerations and required privileges.

*Example*

Your task is to remove Sales class jar file from the `SALES` schema.

Do the following using trafci:

```
$ trafci
Welcome to Apache Trafodion Command Interface
Copyright (c) 2015 Apache Software Foundation

Host Name/IP Address: localhost:23400
User Name: zz

Connected to Trafodion

SQL> get libraries in schema trafodion.sales ;

SALES

--- SQL operation complete.

SQL> DROP LIBRARY trafodion.sales.saleslib ;

--- SQL operation complete.

SQL>
```

<<<
[[display-libraries]]
== Display Libraries

Refer to the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual]
for full documentation of the
{docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#get_statement[GET]
statement.

Use the `GET libraries [ in schema [ catalog-name.] schema-name ] statement in trafci to
display the libraries in a schema.

*Example*

```
$ trafci

User Name: zz
