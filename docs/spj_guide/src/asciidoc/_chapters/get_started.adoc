[[get-started]]
= Get Started

Before you can start using SPJs on {project-name}, verify that
you have the required software installed on the client workstation.
{project-name} is delivered to you ready to use and pre-configured
with the software required to support SPJs.

[[required-client-software]]
== Required Client Software

[[java-development-kit]]
=== Java Development Kit

To develop Java methods to be used as SPJs, you must have a Java
Development Kit (JDK) installed on the client workstation. To download a
JDK, go to
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html

The version of the JDK that you download and use on the client
workstation should be the same as or lower than the Java version running
on {project-name}. To check the Java version that is running in
{project-name}, use this approach:

* Launch `trafci` on {project-name}, and run the `LOCALHOST` or `lh java -version` command.
(To use the on-platform trafci client, see the
{docs-url}/command_interface/index.html[{project-name} Command Interface Guide].
+
For example:
+
```
SQL> lh java -version

java version "1.6.0_06"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_06-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 10.0-b22, mixed mode)

SQL>
```
+
In this example, the returned Java version indicates that the {project-name}
instance supports Java SE 6 or JDK 6 (1.6.0), or earlier versions of the
JDK.

NOTE: If you plan to install the {project-name} JDBC Type-4 Driver on the client
workstation, you must have JDK 6 (1.6.0) or higher installed on the
client workstation.

[[trafodion-command-interface-trafci]]
=== Trafodion Command Interface (trafci)

`trafci` is a command-line interface in which you can run SQL statements,
such as GRANT PROCEDURE and CALL statements, interactively or from
script files. To install `trafci` on a client workstation, see the
{docs-url}/client_install/index.html[{project-name} Client Installation Guide].

[[hp-jdbc-type-4-driver]]
=== HP JDBC Type 4 Driver

If you plan to use `trafci`, you must have a compatible version of the {project-name}
JDBC Type-4 Driver installed on the client workstation.

To install the JDBC Type-4 driver on the client workstation, see the 
{docs-url}/client_install/index.html[{project-name} Client Installation Guide].
