== Load Methods
There are two methods used to load data into a Trafodion table. Both methods can run while the database is concurrently queried: 

[cols="20%,40%,40%",options="header"]
|===
| Type           | Description         | Methods/Tools
| *Bulk Load* | Large data volumes +
Stage data and load in the batches | Trafodion Bulk Loader
| *Trickle Load* | Small data volumes +
Insert data at it arrives | odb tool +
ETL tool or custom ODBC/JDBC application
|===

These two methods use four types of SQL insert statements

* *Bulk Load*
** http://trafodion.apache.org/docs/sql_reference/index.html#load_statement[LOAD]

* *Trickle Load*
** http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/docs/sql_reference/index.html#insert_statement[INSERT]
** http://trafodion.apache.org/docs/sql_reference/index.html#upsert_statement[UPSERT]
** http://trafodion.apache.org/docs/sql_reference/index.html#upsert_statement[UPSERT USING LOAD]

The http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/docs/sql_reference/index.html[Trafodion SQL Reference Manual]
provides syntax descriptions for these statements.

The data source defines what type of load approach and method you use:

* *Bulk Load* (LOAD statement)
** _Text Files_: Map an external Hive table.
** _JDBC-Compliant Database_: Load into Hive on the Trafodion cluster using `sqoop`.
** _Hive Tables_: Direct load.
** _Native HBase Tables_: Direct load.
** _Disparate Data Source_: Write Java/C++ UDF to read data from source and pass rows to LOAD.

* *Trickle Load* (odb utility)
** _Text Files_: Direct access
** _pipes_: Via `stdin`
** _ODBC-Compliant Database_: odb COPY command, no intermediate storage

For more information, refer to:

* <<bulk-load,Bulk Load>>
* <<trickle-load, Trickle Load>>

[[introduction-insert-types]]
=== Insert Types

The following insert types are supported in Trafodion:

* `INSERT INTO T &#8230;`
* `UPSERT INTO T &#8230;`
* `UPSERT USING LOAD INTO T &#8230;`
* `LOAD INTO T &#8230;`

The following table compares the different insert types:

[cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",options="header"]
|===
| Characteristic | INSERT | UPSERT | UPSERT USING LOAD | LOAD
| *Transaction* | Yes | Yes | No, uses HBase WAL for recovery | No, uses snapshot for recovery
| *Method of Operation* | Uses the standard HBase write path through its `CheckAndPut` call. Rows are held in transaction co-processor memory until the transaction is committed. | Uses the standard HBase write path through its `Put` call. | Uses the standard HBase write path through its `Put` call. | Uses the HBase bulk load write path and creates HFiles directly, bypassing HBase RegionServers for most of its operation.
| *Uniqueness Constraint* | Enforced | Not enforced. New row with the same key value overwrites previous row. | Not enforced. New row with same key value overwrites the previous row. | Enforced only within the set of rows in a single statement. Not enforced with rows already in the table.
| *Index* | Can be used on a table with an index. | Can be used on a table with an index. | When used on a table with an index, it reverts to UPSERT. | Can be used on a table with an index. Index is off-line during the LOAD.
| *Max Size/Invocation* | 10,000 * n^1^ rows | 10,000 * n^1^ rows | 5 million * n^1^ rows | 2 billion * n^1^ rows
| *Min Size/Invocation* | 1 row | 1 row | 1 row | Suitable for greater than 1 million * n^1^ rows
| *Speed* | Slowest | Faster than INSERT | Faster than UPSERT | Fastest
|===

^1^ *n* is the number of nodes in each invocation.

Throughput, max/min sizes depends on multiple factors:

* Format of rows in Trafodion table (aligned format or not).
* Length of row.
* Number of columns in row.
* Data type of columns.
* Network between nodes in cluster.
* WAL setting.
* Number of clients.
* Use of rowsets.

== Unload

The Trafodion UNLOAD statement exports data from Trafodion tables into an HDFS directory. Refer to <<bulk-unload,Bulk Unload>> for more information.
