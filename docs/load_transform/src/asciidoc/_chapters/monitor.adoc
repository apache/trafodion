= Monitor Progress

== INSERT and UPSERT

For an INSERT statement, rows are written to the HBase table that represents the {project-name} table when the transaction commits. 
It is more difficult to see query progress here.

== UPSERT USING LOAD

For an UPSERT USING LOAD statement, rows added are visible in the {project-name} table after each `ListOfPut` call succeeds. 
You can use a `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement to monitor progress. That way, you know how many rows are already in the table when the 
statement starts executing. 

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trafodion.sch.demo ;
```

== LOAD
For LOAD, query progress goes through a few phases, which sometimes overlap:

1. Hive scan.
2. Sort.
3. Create prep HFiles in HDFS bulkload staging directory (`/bulkload` by default).
4. Move HFiles into HBase.

You can monitor progress in step 2, sort, with this shell command:

```
lsof +L1 | grep SCR | wc -l
```

This command returns a count of the number of overflow files for sort. Each file is 2GB in size.
You need to have an approximate idea of  the volume of data being loaded to know how much more
data needs to be sorted. On a cluster, sort is done on all nodes with a pdsh-like utility.
{project-name} data volume can also be larger than Hive data volume by a factor of 2 or 3. 

In step 3, create prep HFiles, use the following command to monitor the volume of data written
out to the staging directory:

```
hadoop fs -dus /bulkload 
```

The `hadoop fs` command must be run from one node and does not have to be repeated across the cluster.

If compression and encoding are used, then the size should be similar to the Hive source data volume.
There may be some remnant data in the staging directory from previous commands, so we have to 
take that into account. This step will start only when sort has completed.

Step 4 is usually the shortest and typically does not exceed a few minutes.
