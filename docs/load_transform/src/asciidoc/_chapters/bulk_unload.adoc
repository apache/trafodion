[[bulk-unload]]
= Bulk Unload

The {docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#unload_statement[UNLOAD] statement is a
{project-name} extension that exports data from {project-name} tables into an HDFS location that you specify. 
Refer to the {docs-url}/sql_reference/index.html#unload_statement[{project-name} SQL Reference Manual]
for complete documentation.

The extracted data can be either compressed or uncompressed based on what you choose. 
UNLOAD performs multiple steps based on the options you give; for example:

* If using snapshot scan:
** Get list of {project-name} tables from the query plan.
** Create/verify snapshots.

* Purge target location, if specified

* Extract: 
** Copy table data to data files.
** Non-compressed is straight copy.
** Compressed means compression takes place while writing data (no extra step)

* Merge Data Files if specified

*Example*

This example shows how the UNLOAD statement extracts data from a
{project-name} table, `TRAFODION.HBASE.CUSTOMER_DEMOGRAPHICS`, into an HDFS
folder, `/bulkload/customer_demographics`:

```
>>UNLOAD
+>WITH PURGEDATA FROM TARGET
+>MERGE FILE 'merged_customer_demogs.gz' OVERWRITE
+>COMPRESSION GZIP
+>INTO '/bulkload/customer_demographics'
+>SELECT * FROM trafodion.hbase.customer_demographics
+><<+ cardinality 10e10 ,+ cardinality 10e10 >>;
