== A. Troubleshooting
1.  odb uses Condition Variables to synchronize threads during copy and parallel load operations.
2.  Most of the memory allocation operations are dynamic. For example, you can execute an SQL
command as long as you want. However, you can _hard code_ limits as follows:
+
[source,cplusplus]
--
#define MAX_VNLEN   32 /* Max variable name length */
#define MAXCOL_LEN 128 /* Max column name length */
#define MAXOBJ_LEN 128 /* Max catalog/schema/table name length */
#define MAX_CLV     64 /* Max command line variables (-var) */
--

3.  Some Linux/UNIX systems (notably the Linux Loader) have huge default stack size. Due to this
extremely large value, you can have errors like this when starting tens/hundreds of threads:
+
```
Error starting cmd thread #: cannot allocate memory
```
+
If you get this error, then check your default stack size:
+
```
$ ulimit -a
core file size                         (blocks, -c) 0
data seg size                          (kbytes, -d) unlimited
max nice                                       (-e) 0
file size                              (blocks, -f) unlimited
pending signals                                (-i) 137215
max locked memory                      (kbytes, -l) 32
max memory size                        (kbytes, -m) unlimited
open files                                     (-n) 65536
pipe size                           (512 bytes, -p) 8
POSIX message queues                    (bytes, -q) 819200
max rt priority                                (-r) 0
stack size                             (kbytes, -s) 204800
cpu time                              (seconds, -t) unlimited
max user processes                             (-u) 2047
virtual memory                         (kbytes, -v) unlimited
file locks                                     (-x) unlimited
```
+
In the example above, the `stack size` value is the problem. Reset it to a reasonable value. (The value will be reset to the initial value when you start a new session).
+
<<<
+
*Example*
+
```
$ ulimit -s 4096
```

4. If you get errors such as:
+
```
C:\Users\felici> odb64luo -u xx -p yy -d oraxe -l src=region.tbl.gz:tgt=region:fs=^|:truncate

odb [2012-10-11 13:27:22]: starting ODBC connection(s)... 0 
[0] odb(5020) - [Oracle][ODBC]Optional feature not implemented. (State: HYC00 Native Err: 0)
```
+
Try adding `-nocatnull` to your command line. When the back-end database doesn't use catalogs, 
then you should use an *empty string* as catalog name.
+
NOTE: Some flawed ODBC Drivers unfortunately want NULL here &#8212; instead of *empty strings* as it should be.

5.  You can have errors loading `TIME(N)` fields with` N>0` under {project-name} because the
ODBC Driver does not manage the field display size when `N>0`.
6.  If you have problems starting odb on Unix/Linux check:
+
* The shared library dependencies with `ldd <odb_executable_name>`.
* The shared lib path defined in the following environment variables used by the shared library loader:
** *Linux*: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
** *IBM IAX*: `LIBPATH` (not currently supported)
** *HP/UX*: `SHLIB_PATH` (not currently supported)
