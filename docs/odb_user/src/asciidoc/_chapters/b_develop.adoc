== B. Develop and Test odb
=== Develop

odb is coded in "ANSI C" (K&R programming style) and is compiled in a 64-bit version on the Linux platform, linked
to the unixODBC driver manager. Other platforms, compilers, and ODBC libraries have not yet been tested.

|===
| Platform | Compiler | ODBC Libraries | Note
| **Linux** | gcc | unixODBC (supported), iODBC (not currently supported), Data Direct (not currently supported), Teradata (not currently supported) | 64 bit (32 bit is not currently supported)
| **MS-Windows** +
(not tested) | Visual Studio (not tested) | MS-Windows (not tested) | 64 bit
|===

C compilers are set with “all warnings” enabled and odb has to compile, on each platform, with no errors (of course) AND no warnings. Tools used
to code odb:

* **vim** (http://www.vim.org) as editor (or Visual Studio embedded editor)
* **splint** (http://www.splint.org) to statically check the source code

=== Test

The info, load, extract, and copy operations of odb have been fully tested. In addition, odb had been tested using a set of
137 standard tests to check functionalities and identify memory/thread issues.
