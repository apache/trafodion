= Introduction
== What is odb
odb is a platform independent, multi-threaded, ODBC command-line tool you can use as a:

* Parallel data loader/extractor
* Query driver (Technology Preview)
* SQL interpreter (Technology Preview)

odb is written in ANSI C. Currently, odb is available only in a 64-bit version for the Linux platform,
linked to the unixODBC driver manager.

odb executables use the following naming convention, `*_odbAABCC_*`, where:

* `*AA*` can be 64 (bit) (32 bit is not currently supported).
* `*B*` identifies the platform/compiler:
* `l` = Linux/gcc
* `w` = Windows/MS Visual Studio (not yet tested)
* `*CC*` identifies the ODBC Driver Manager to which odb was linked:
* `uo` = unixODBC Driver Manager
* `ms` = Microsoft ODBC Driver Manager (not yet tested)

So, for example:

* `*odb64luo*` is the 64-bit executable for Linux linked with the unixODBC Driver Manager.

This document contains examples run with the `*odb64luo*` executable.
