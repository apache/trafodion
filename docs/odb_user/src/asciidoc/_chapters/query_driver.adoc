= odb as a Query Driver (Technology Preview)

== Getting CSV Output
It’s often handy to get a CSV output ready to be imported into your spreadsheet while running performance tests. You can easily get this kind
of output with `–c` odb option.

*Example*

```
$ ./odb64luo -u mauro -p xxx -d pglocal -x 3:"select count(*) from tpch.region" \
-f 5:Q01.sql -f 3:Q02.sql -T 4 -q –c
```

This command runs:

* Three copies of the `select count(*): -x 3:”select count(*) from tpch.region”`
* Five copies of `Q01.sql: -f 5:Q01.sql`
* Three copies of `Q02: -f 3:Q02.sql`
* Queuing the resulting 11 executions into four threads: `-T 4`
* Omitting query text and query results (`-q` is equivalent to `–q all`): `-q`
* Printing a CSV output: `–c`

<<<
The command produces the following output:

The CSV output columns have the following meaning:

[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Column         | Meaning
| `Thread ID`    | Thread ID. Number of threads limited to 4 &#8212;> thread id values are 0, 1, 2, 3
| `Proc ID`      | Execution number. 11 executions in the 0-10 range.
| `Thread Exec#` | Progressive number (starting from 0) of execution for a specific thread.
| `Script Cmd#`  | If your script contains multiple SQL statement, then they are numbered starting from zero.
| `File`         | Script file name or `(null)` for `–x` commands.
| `Label`        | The label assigned though `set qlabel` in the scripts.
| `Command`      | First 30 characters of the SQL command. It will end with `>` if the command text was truncated.
| `Rows`         | The number of returned rows. Not printed if you used `–q`.
| `Rsds`         | Record Set Display Size. Gives you an idea of _how big_ the result set is.
| `Prepare(s)`   | Prepare (compile) time in seconds.
| `Exec(s)`      | Execution time in seconds.
| `1st Fetch(s)` | Time needed to fetch the first row in seconds.

== Assign Label to a Query

Sometimes it’s not easy to recognize a query by reading the first 30 characters. Therefore, odb lets you
assign a label to a generic query using:

```
SET QLABEL <label>
```

*Example*

```
~/Devel/odb $ cat script.sql

-- {project-name} TPC-H Query 1 SET QLABEL Q01
SELECT
   L_RETURNFLAG
 , L_LINESTATUS
 , SUM(L_QUANTITY) AS SUM_QTY
 ...
 
-- TPC-H/TPC-R Minimum Cost Supplier Query (Q2)
SET QLABEL Q02
SELECT
   S_ACCTBAL
   , S_NAME
   ...
```

Running this script includes the Query Label in the CSV output:

```
~/Devel/odb $ ./odb64luo -u mauro -p xxx -d pglocal -f script.sql -q -c

[[query_driver_all_scripts_path]]
== Run All Scripts With a Given Path

Using `-S <path>` or `-P <path>` options you can run all scripts with a given path
(for example, all files in a directory) either serially (`-S`) or in parallel (`-P`).

Both options let you to use *_multiplying factors_* to run all scripts multiple times.
This multiplying factors are defined with a `<number>:` preceding the script path.

*Examples*

[cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
| odb Command Line                             | Action
| `odb64luo -S ./test/queries/*.sql - c -q`    | Executes *serially* all scripts with extension `.sql` under
`./test/queries/` providing CSV type output (`-c`) and omitting query output (`-q`).
| `odb64luo -P test/queries/* -T 50 - c -q`    | Runs *in parallel* all files under `test/queries/` using 50 threads
(ODBC connections) (`-T 50`), with CSV output (`-c`) and omitting query output (`-q`).
| `odb64luo -P 3: test/queries/* -T 3 -c -q`   | Runs *in parallel three times (`3:`)* all files under `test/queries/`
using three threads (ODBC connections) (`-T 3`), with CSV output (`-c`) and omitting query output (`-q`).
Scripts will be assigned to threads using *_standard assignment_*.
| `odb64luo -P -3: test/queries/* -T 3 -c -q`  | Runs *in parallel three times (`-3:`)* all files under `test/queries/`
using three threads (ODBC connections) (`-T 3`), with CSV type output (`-c`) and omitting query output (`-q`).
Scripts will be assigned to threads using *_round-robin assignment_*.
|===

To understand the difference between *standard* and *round-robin* assignments, imagine you have four scripts in
the target path. This is how the executions will be assigned to threads:

[cols="16%,14%,14%,14%,14%,14%,14%"]
|===
| 3+^h| Standard Assignment (es. -P 3:) 3+^h| Round-Robin Assignment (es. -P -3:)
| h| Thread 1 h| Thread 2 h| Thread 3 h| Thread 1 h| Thread 2 h| Thread 3 
| nth execution | &#8230;           | &#8230;           |               | &#8230;           | &#8230;           | 
| 4th execution | `Script4.sql` | `Script4.sql` | `&#8230;`         | `Script2.sql` | `Script3.sql` | `&#8230;`
| 3rd execution | `Script3.sql` | `Script3.sql` | `Script3.sql` | `Script3.sql` | `Script4.sql` | `Script1.sql`
| 2nd execution | `Script2.sql` | `Script2.sql` | `Script2.sql` | `Script4.sql` | `Script1.sql` | `Script2.sql`
| 1st execution | `Script1.sql` | `Script1.sql` | `Script1.sql` | `Script1.sql` | `Script2.sql` | `Script3.sql`
|===

<<<
== Randomizing Execution Order

You can use the `-Z` option to _shuffle_ the odb internal execution table.
This way the execution order is not predictable.

*Examples*

[cols="45%,55%",options="header"]
|===
| odb Command Line                                  | Action
| `odb64luo&#8230; -S 3: test/queries/* -Z -c –q`       | Executes three times (`3:`) all files in the `test/queries` directory
serially (`-S`) and in random order (`-Z`).
| `odb64luo&#8230; -P 3: test/queries/* -Z –T 5 - c -q` | Executes three times (`3:`) all files in the `test/queries` directory in
parallel (`-P`), using five threads (`-T 5`) and in random order (`-Z`).
|===

== Defining a Timeout

You can stop odb after a given timeout (assuming the execution is not already completed) using `-maxtime <seconds>` option.

*Example*

```
~/Devel/odb $ ./odb64luo -S /home/mauro/scripts/*.sql –maxtime 7200
```

The command executes, *serially,*( all scripts with extension `.sql` under
`/home/mauro/scripts/`; if the execution is not completed after two hours (7200 seconds), then odb stops.

<<<
== Simulating User Thinking Time

You can simulate user *_thinking time_* using the `-ttime <delay>` option.
This argument introduces a `<delay>` millisecond pause between two consecutive executions in the same thread.

*Example*

```
~/src/C/odb $ ./odb64luo -f 5:script1.sql -c -q -ttime 75 -T 2
```

This command runs five times `script1.sql` using two threads. Each thread waits 75 milliseconds before starting
the next execution within a thread. You can also use a *_random thinking time_* in a given `min:max` range.

*Example*

The following command starts commands within a thread with a random delay between 50 and 500 milliseconds:

```
~/src/C/odb $ ./odb64luo -f 5:script1.sql -c -q -ttime 50:500 -T 2
```

== Starting Threads Gracefully

You might want to wait a little before starting the next thread. This can be obtained using the `-delay` option.

*Example*

```
~/src/C/odb $ ./odb64luo -f 5:script1.sql -c -q -delay 200 -T 2
```

This command runs five times `script1.sql` using two threads. Each thread will be started 200 milliseconds after the other.

NOTE: `-delay` introduces a delay during threads start-up while `–ttime` introduces a delay between one command and another within the same
thread.

<<<
== Re-looping a Given Workload

Using `-L` option you can re-loop the workload defined through `-x`, `-f`, `-P`, and `-S` commands a given number of times.
Each thread will re-loop the same number of times.

*Example*

```
~/src/C/odb $ *./*odb64luo -f 5:script1.sql -c -q -M 75 -T 2 -L 3
```

re-loops three times (`-L 3`) the same five executions, using two threads (`-T 2`) with a 75 millisecond pause (`-M 75`) between two
consecutive executions in the same thread.
