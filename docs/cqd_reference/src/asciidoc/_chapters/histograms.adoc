This section describes CQDs that are used to manage histograms.

[[cache-histograms-refresh-interval]]
== CACHE_HISTOGRAMS_REFRESH_INTERVAL

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Defines the time interval after which timestamps for cached histograms are checked for refresh processing.
| *Values*                    | Unsigned integer in seconds. +
 + 
The default value is *'3600'* (1 hour).
| *Usage*                     | Histogram statistics are cached so that the compiler can avoid access to the metadata tables, thereby reducing compile times.
The timestamp of the tables are checked against those of the cached histograms at an interval specified by this CQD, in order to see if the cached histograms
need to be refreshed. +
 +
You can increase the interval to reduce the impact on compile times as long as you do not need to obtain fresh statistics more frequently in order to improve
query performance. It may be that the default interval is too long and you would rather refresh the statistics more frequently than the default one hour,
in order to improve query performance at the cost of increased compile times. +
 +
This setting depends on how frequently you are updating statistics on tables. There is no point in refreshing statistics frequently when statistics are not
being updated during that time. On the other hand, if you are updating statistics, or generating them for the first time on freshly loaded tables frequently
enough, and you want these to be picked up immediately by the compiler because you have seen this to have a dramatic impact on plan quality, then you can
make the refresh more frequent.
| *Production Usage*          | Not applicable.
| *Impact*                    | Longer histogram refresh intervals can improve compile times. However, longer refresh intervals yield more obsolete
the histograms. More obsolete histograms may result in poor performance for queries that could leverage recently updated statistics.
| *Level*                     | System or Service.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Frequency of update statistics run using MAINTAIN.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.

[[hist-missing-stats-warning-level]]
== HIST_MISSING_STATS_WARNING_LEVEL

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Controls the level of missing statistics warnings that should be displayed. The warnings impacted are 6007, 6008, 6010, and 6011.
| *Values*                    |
*'0'*: Display no warnings. +
 +
*'1'*: Display only missing single column statistics warnings. These include 6008 and 6011. +
 +
*'2'*: Display all missing single and multi-column statistics warnings for scans only. +
 +
*'3'*: Display all missing single and multi-column statistics warnings for scans and join operators only. +
 +
*'4'*: Display all missing single and multi-column statistics warnings. +
 +
The default value is *'4'*.
| *Usage*                     | 
If you do not want to see these warnings, then change the setting to '0'. If you want to track the warnings, then you have a
choice of which warnings you want to track. Each setting gives you the ability to filter the warnings seen for missing single
or multi-column statistics for join or scan operations. This controls the resulting number of warning messages. +
 +
If poor query plans are being caused by cardinality estimations that seem to be off, then you can check the histogram statistics
to see if statistics are being collected for those columns and how accurate they are. If you don't find statistics being collected,
then you could look for the warnings by setting this CQD to the appropriate setting. Based on that you could take appropriate action:
either find out why USAS is not collecting appropriate statistics, or if USAS is not being used then ensure that update statistics
is being run to generate those statistics. 
| *Production Usage*          | Many tools divide a query into several steps. During the first phases volatile tables are created
and populated, the last phase usually joins all the volatile tables created in the previous steps. Usually statistics are not needed
for those volatile tables because the final join is straight forward and the optimizer has no big choices. Nevertheless the log is
flooded with useless warnings if you don't set the warning level to 0. If possible, try to direct queries from those tools to a
dedicated service where you set the warning level to 0.
| *Impact*                    | Though the warnings give information about all statistics that are missing, it can be overwhelming
to get several warnings. Not all warnings may contribute to plan improvements. The optimizer issues multi-column statistics warnings
based on the search path, some of which may not even impact the plan quality. Also, the cost of gathering statistics on those columns
may not bring commensurate benefit to a large number of queries.
| *Level*                     | System.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.

[[hist-no-stats-refresh-interval]]
== HIST_NO_STATS_REFRESH_INTERVAL

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Defines the time interval after which the fake histograms in the cache should be refreshed unconditionally.
| *Values*                    | Unsigned integer. Unit is seconds. +
 + 
The default value is *'3600'* (1 hour).
| *Usage*                     | Histogram statistics are "fake" when update statistics is not being run, but instead the customer is
updating the histogram tables directly with statistics to guide the optimizer. This may be done if the data in the table is very
volatile (such as for temporary tables), update statistics is not possible because of constant flush and fill of the table occurring,
and statistics are manually set to provide some guidance to the optimizer to generate a good plan. +
 +
If these fake statistics are updated constantly to reflect the data churn, then this default can be set to 0. This would ensure that
the histograms with fake statistics are not cached and are always refreshed. If these fake statistics are set and not touched again,
then this interval could be set very high.
| *Production Usage*          | Not applicable.
| *Impact*                    | Setting a high interval improves compilation time. However, if statistics are being updated,
then the compiler may be working with obsolete histogram statistics, potentially resulting in poorer plans.
| *Level*                     | Service.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.

[[hist-prefetch]]
== HIST_PREFETCH

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Influences the compiler to pre-fetch the histograms and save them in cache.
| *Values*                    |
*'ON'*: Pre-fetches the histograms. +
*'OFF'*: Does not pre-fetch the histograms. +
 +
The default value is *'ON'*.
| *Usage*                     | You may want to turn this off if you don't want to pre-fetch a large number of histograms, many of which may not be used.
| *Production Usage*          | Not applicable.
| *Impact*                    | Though it makes compilation time faster, it may result in the histogram cache to be filled with histograms that may never be used.
| *Level*                     | System or Service.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Use this CQD with <<cache-histograms,CACHE_HISTOGRAMS>>. If CACHE_HISTOGRAMS is OFF, then this CQD has no effect.

[[hist-rowcount-requiring-stats]]
== HIST_ROWCOUNT_REQUIRING_STATS

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Specifies the minimum row count for which the {project-name} Optimizer needs histograms, in order to compute better cardinality estimates.
The Optimizer does not issue any missing statistics warnings for tables whose size is smaller than the value of this CQD.
| *Values*                    | Integer. +
 +
The default value is *'50000'*.
| *Usage*                     | Use this CQD to reduce the number of statistics warnings.
| *Production Usage*          | Not applicable.
| *Impact*                    | Missing statistics warnings are not displayed for smaller tables, which in most cases don't impact plan quality much.
However, there may be some exceptions where missing statistics on small tables could result in less than optimal plans.
| *Level*                     | System.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Use this CQD with <<hist-missing-stats-warning-level,HIST_MISSING_STATS_WARNING_LEVEL>>. If the warning level CQD is 0,
then this CQD does not have any effect. Also, for tables having fewer rows than set in this CQD, no warnings are displayed irrespective of the warning level.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.

<<<
[[hist-use-sample-for-cardinality-estimation]]
== HIST_USE_SAMPLE_FOR_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Enables the Compile Time Stats feature. Compile Time Stats are produced during query plan generation by executing a
subset of the query on a subset of data to gather more accurate cardinality estimations.
| *Values*                    |
*'ON'*: Compile Time Statistics is enabled. + 
*'OFF'*: Compile Time Statistics is disabled. +
 +
The default value is *'ON'*.
| *Usage*                     | The feature is very helpful for cases when the query contains complex predicates on a table. These predicates include
LIKE, CASE, any other expressions or more than one range predicates and equality on large character columns. +
 +
It can be disabled if most of the queries are single table or at most two-way joins. +
 +
It can also be disabled if the extra collection of statistics seems to be adversely affecting the total query compile and execution time.
| *Production Usage*          | Not applicable.
| *Impact*                    | The feature improves cardinality estimates for Scan operators thus improving the plan quality.
However, it can also increase the compile time.
| *Level*                     | Any.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | In order to use the feature in its default form, sample tables should exist in `public_access_schema`.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.
