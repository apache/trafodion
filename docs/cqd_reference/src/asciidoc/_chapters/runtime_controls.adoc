= Runtime Controls

This section describes CQDs that are used for runtime controls.

[[last0-mode]]
== LAST0_MODE

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Ensures that all parts of the query plan are executed but no rows are returned by the query.
| *Values*                    | *'ON'* or *'OFF'*. +
 +
The default value is *'OFF'*.
| *Usage*                     | This setting provides a realistic measure of the query's performance, minus the cost/time of
returning the rows to the client. It is especially useful for testing the plans and performance of queries that return large result sets.
| *Production Usage*          | Only use this CQD to assess the performance of a query. 
| *Impact*                    | The query runs completely but no rows are returned.
| *Level*                     | Query.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not to be confused with SELECT [LAST 0] which behaves the same way but does not guarantee that the plan
is the same as when you do not use the [LAST 0] clause in the query.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.

[[query-limit-sql-process-cpu]]
== QUERY_LIMIT_SQL_PROCESS_CPU

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Use to limit the amount of CPU time that a query is allowed to use in any one server process (MXESP)
including the NDCS server (MXOSRVR). Also includes the CPU time the query spends in the disk process (ESAM). +
 +
If a query exceeds the limit, then an error is raised and the query is terminated. This is a way to limit the impact on the
system of a poorly written or badly optimized query.
| *Values*                    |
*'0'*:  There is no limit. +
*Greater than *'0'* and up through *'2,147,483,583'*: The limit, in seconds, to how much CPU time a query is allowed. +
 +
The default value is *'0'*.
| *Usage*                     | This setting helps you with queries that are poorly written or are badly optimized. A poorly written
query does not use predicates to limit the number of rows processed. A query that joins large tables without a predicate can have a
severe impact on the system. A badly optimized query can result from failure to maintain histograms. Typically, these are ad-hoc queries. +
 +
These types of queries seldom run to completion, and are instead stopped after the problems that they cause to other users of the system are noticed.
| *Production Usage*          | Not applicable.
| *Impact*                    | Use of this default can prevent any one query from using an unlimited amount of CPU time.
However, if the default is set too low, then even well behaved, useful queries fail to complete.
| *Level*                     | Service.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Use standard processed for creating high-quality queries, and procedures that ensure that table histograms are always current.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.
