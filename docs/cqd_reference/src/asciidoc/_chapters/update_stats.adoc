[[ustat-max-read-age-in-min]]
== USTAT_MAX_READ_AGE_IN_MIN

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | When performing update statistics with the NECESSARY keyword or with automation, this is
the number of minutes that are allowed to have elapsed since a histogram was marked as read for it to be regenerated. +
 +
Histograms that were marked more than USTAT_MAX_READ_AGE_IN_MIN minutes ago are not regenerated.
| *Values*                    | 0 through max unsigned integer. +
 +
Setting this CQD to a value less than 2 * USTAT_AUTOMATION_INTERVAL is silently ignored and
2 * USTAT_AUTOMATION_INTERVAL (default value of 2880) is used. +
 +
The default value is 5760 (4 days).
| *Usage*                     | Influences how frequently the histograms for a table are regenerated.
If a table is being used frequently, then chances are that its histograms are also be considered for update frequently.
However, if a table is not used frequently, then this CQD influences how frequently the histograms for that table are updated. +
 +
A smaller setting reduces the number of histograms being updated if there are many tables that have not been used within that interval.
A larger setting updates histogram for many more tables that are not being accessed that often.
| *Production Usage*          | Please contact {project-support}.
| *Impact*                    | Influences the number of histograms that need to be regenerated and therefore the time it takes for
update statistics automation to regenerate histograms for all the tables that so qualify.
| *Level*                     | System.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | USTAT_AUTOMATION_INTERVAL sets a lower bound on this CQD. +
 +
It is influenced by USTAT_AUTO_READTIME_UPDATE_INTERVAL, which influences how often READ_TIME is updated for the histogram.
This CQD qualifies the histogram to be regenerated; it is the maximum time since READ_TIME was updated. $$$
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.

[[ustat-min-rowcount-for-sample]]
== USTAT_MIN_ROWCOUNT_FOR_SAMPLE

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Sets the minimum rows that need to be in a table before sampling is used to update statistics for that table.
If a table has a fewer rows than the value of this CQD, then the SAMPLE option is silently ignored when performing update statistics.
| *Values*                    | 1 through max unsigned integer. +
 +
The default value is 10000.
| *Usage*                     | Influences for what tables sampling is used for histogram statistics generation. If the setting is smaller,
then more tables qualify for sampling. If the setting is larger, then fewer tables qualify for sampling. Sampling can result in faster update
statistics run times. But for smaller tables, it can also result in poor histogram accuracy which could result in poor query plans. 
| *Production Usage*          | Please contact {project-support}.
| *Impact*                    | Setting this CQD to a smaller value means that sampling is used for tables with fewer rows, when the SAMPLE option is
specified as part of update statistics. This can result in less accurate histograms and poor query plans, because the sample size may be too small to
generate good estimates for histograms. +
 +
Setting this CQD to a larger value can result in sampling not being used for many tables and therefore longer update statistics run times.
However, these tables may also have more accurate histograms.

== USTAT_MIN_ROWCOUNT_FOR_LOW_SAMPLE

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Defines the behavior of the UPDATE STATISTICS utility. It places a lower limit on the number of sample rows that will be used when sampling. +
 +
If the number of rows in the table is less than this value and sampling is used, then the sample size used will be that specified by
the <<hist-default-sample-min,HIST_DEFAULT_SAMPLE_MIN>> CQD. (which defaults to 10,000).
| *Values*                    | This CQD may take on any integer value greater than zero. +
 +
The default for this CQD is *1,000,000*.
| *Usage*                     | Prevents accidental use of too-small samples when generating statistics on tables. If sample sizes are too small,
then histogram statistics will be less accurate, leading to potentially less efficient query plans.
| *Production Usage*          | Please contact {project-support}.
| *Impact*                    | Setting this CQD to lower values may result in smaller sample sizes for small tables.
This may slightly improve UPDATE STATISTICS run time, but at the cost of potentially less efficient queries.
| *Level*                     | System.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | <<hist-default-sample-min,HIST_DEFAULT_SAMPLE_MIN>> effects the behavior of this CQD.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
