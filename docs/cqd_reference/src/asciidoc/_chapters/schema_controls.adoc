| *Values*                    | Any valid ANSI name, including delimited names. +
 +
The default is *'TRAFODION'*.
| *Usage*                     | Trafodion tables must be in a catalog called TRAFODION. If you mostly access Hive or native HBase tables,
then the catalog could be changed to HIVE or HBASE respectively. +
 +
The default setting is overridden by any catalog name specified in a SQL statement.
| *Production Usage*          | Yes.
| *Impact*                    | Not applicable.
| *Level*                     | Any.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Alternately you can use the SET CATALOG statement.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | Trafodion 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.
