This section describes CQDs that are used for table definition

[[auto-query-retry-warnings]]
== ALLOW_NULLABLE_UNIQUE_KEY_CONSTRAINT

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Allow Trafodion tables to be created with NULLABLE columns in the PRIMARY or STORE BY key.
| *Values*                    | *'ON'* or *'OFF'* +
 +
The default value is *'OFF'*.
| *Usage*                     | Allows NULLABLE columns to be included in the PRIMARY or STORE BY key for Trafodion tables. 
This CQD must be set prior to creating the table. It is not necessary to specify this CQD during DML operations on the table. +
 +
When performing UPDATE STATISTICS with SAMPLE option on such tables, this CQD must be set so that an appropriate sample table can be created.
| *Production Usage*          | Please consult with the Trafodion community.
| *Impact*                    | Two bytes are added to the key for each nullable column.
| *Level*                     | Session.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | Trafodion 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.

[[hbase-block-size]]
== HBASE_BLOCK_SIZE

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Allow Trafodion tables to be created with specified HBase block size.
| *Values*                    | Positive integer. +
 +
The default value is *'65536'*.
| *Usage*                     | The value of this attribute is passed on to HBase when a Trafodion table is created in HBase. 
See the https://hbase.apache.org/book.html[Apache HBase(TM) Reference Guide] for usage information .
| *Production Usage*          | Yes.
| *Impact*                    | The impact depends on the type of table access. Choose a block size that is appropriate 
for how the table is primarily accessed.
| *Level*                     | System.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | Trafodion 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.

 +
Default: *'UTF8'*
| *Usage*                     | Set this to ISO88591 when reading from Hive tables with ISO8859-1 data.
| *Production Usage*          | Yes.
| *Impact*                    | Not applicable.
| *Level*                     | System.

[[hive-file-charset]]
== HIVE_FILE_CHARSET

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | For certain character sets that are not supported in Trafodion, you can specify the character set here
causing Trafodion to automatically convert the data to the character set specified in the HIVE_DEFAULT_CHARSET CQD. +
 +
This feature is currently supported only for *'GBK'*, and only if HIVE_DEFAULT_CHARSET is set to *'UTF8'*.
| *Values*                    | 
empty or *'GBK'* +
 +
Default: empty
| *Usage*                     | Leave this blank, unless you want to access GBK data in Hive tables.

== HIVE_MAX_STRING_LENGTH

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Hive columns of type STRING have a maximum length in Trafodion, which you can specify with this CQD. +
 +
*NOTE* For UTF-8 data, this length is specified in bytes, not UTF-8 characters.
| *Values*                    | 
1-n. +
