This section describes CQDs that are used for table definition

[[auto-query-retry-warnings]]
== ALLOW_NULLABLE_UNIQUE_KEY_CONSTRAINT

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Allow {project-name} tables to be created with NULLABLE columns in the PRIMARY or STORE BY key.
| *Values*                    | *'ON'* or *'OFF'* +
 +
The default value is *'OFF'*.
| *Usage*                     | Allows NULLABLE columns to be included in the PRIMARY or STORE BY key for {project-name} tables. 
This CQD must be set prior to creating the table. It is not necessary to specify this CQD during DML operations on the table. +
 +
When performing UPDATE STATISTICS with SAMPLE option on such tables, this CQD must be set so that an appropriate sample table can be created.
| *Production Usage*          | Please contact {project-support}.
| *Impact*                    | Two bytes are added to the key for each nullable column.
| *Level*                     | Session.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.

[[hbase-block-size]]
== HBASE_BLOCK_SIZE

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Allow {project-name} tables to be created with specified HBase block size.
| *Values*                    | Positive integer. +
 +
The default value is *'65536'*.
| *Usage*                     | The value of this attribute is passed on to HBase when a {project-name} table is created in HBase. 
See the https://hbase.apache.org/book.html[Apache HBase(TM) Reference Guide] for usage information .
| *Production Usage*          | Yes.
| *Impact*                    | The impact depends on the type of table access. Choose a block size that is appropriate 
for how the table is primarily accessed.
| *Level*                     | System.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.
| *Real Problem Addressed*    | Not applicable.
| *Introduced In Release*     | {project-name} 1.3.0.
| *Deprecated In Release*     | Not applicable.

[[hive-default-charset]]
== HIVE_DEFAULT_CHARSET

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Defines what character set the columns of Hive tables should have.
| *Values*                    | 
*'ISO88591'* or *'UTF8'* +
 +
Default: *'UTF8'*
| *Usage*                     | Set this to ISO88591 when reading from Hive tables with ISO8859-1 data.
| *Production Usage*          | Yes.
| *Impact*                    | Not applicable.
| *Level*                     | System.
| *Conflicts/Synergies*       | Not applicable.

[[hive-file-charset]]
== HIVE_FILE_CHARSET

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | For certain character sets that are not supported in {project-name}, you can specify the character set here
causing {project-name} to automatically convert the data to the character set specified in the HIVE_DEFAULT_CHARSET CQD. +
 +
This feature is currently supported only for *'GBK'*, and only if HIVE_DEFAULT_CHARSET is set to *'UTF8'*.
| *Values*                    | 
empty or *'GBK'* +
 +
Default: empty
| *Usage*                     | Leave this blank, unless you want to access GBK data in Hive tables.

[[hive-max-string-length]]
== HIVE_MAX_STRING_LENGTH

[cols="25%h,75%"]
|===
| *Description*               | Hive columns of type STRING have a maximum length in {project-name}, which you can specify with this CQD. +
 +
*NOTE* For UTF-8 data, this length is specified in bytes, not UTF-8 characters.
| *Values*                    | 
1-n. +
